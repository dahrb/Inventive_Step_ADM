    "answer": "The invention is a catheter‑like medical device (or system) for treating or diagnosing tissue inside the body. It features an elongate tubular shaft with proximal and distal sections separated by a flexible member of known stiffness. A first electromagnetic coil and a first electrically passive element (e.g., a material that affects the coil’s electrical properties) are placed at different locations along the shaft. When the distal tip contacts tissue, the flexible member deforms, causing relative movement between the coil and the passive element. This movement alters the coil’s electrical characteristic, producing a signal that indicates both the amount of deformation and the contact force. In the system embodiment, an electronic control unit excites the coil and measures the change to determine a specific force magnitude.",
    "reasoning": "The description of the invention can be derived from claim 1 of the main request and the auxiliary requests. All claims define a medical device (or system) comprising an elongate tubular shaft with proximal and distal portions, a flexible member of predetermined stiffness between those portions, a first electromagnetic coil, and a first electrically passive element (e.g., a material that influences the coil’s electrical characteristic). The coil and the passive element are positioned so that one moves with the distal portion of the shaft while the other remains stationary, causing relative movement when the distal tip contacts tissue and the flexible member deforms. This relative movement changes the electrical characteristic of the coil, providing a signal indicative of the deformation of the flexible member and the contact force. Auxiliary requests add that the coil can be both electrically excited and transmit signals, and that an electronic control unit can excite the coil and measure the change to determine a specific contact force magnitude. This information is taken directly from the claim language in the case data.",

The practitioner has access to the relevant prior‑art publications (D2, D4, D6, and the high‑sensitivity pressure‑sensing probe) and can combine these teachings to solve technical problems in the field.\n\nClosest Prior: The candidate for the closest prior art is the US patent titled \"High‑sensitivity pressure‑sensing probe\". It discloses a medical probe comprising: (i) an insertion tube having a longitudinal axis and a distal end; (ii) a distal tip mounted at the distal end of the tube, configured to contact body tissue; (iii) a joint that couples the distal tip to the distal end of the insertion tube; and (iv) a joint sensor, located within the probe, that senses the position of the distal tip relative to the insertion tube. The joint sensor includes first and second sub‑assemblies placed on opposite sides of the joint, each sub‑assembly comprising one or more magnetic transducers (preferably coils). One sub‑assembly can be driven by an electrical current to generate a magnetic field, while the other sub‑assembly detects signals induced by that field. By processing these signals the system can determine axial displacement and angular deflection of the distal tip, which can be used to infer the pressure exerted on the tissue. Additional features disclosed include a resilient joint that deforms under pressure, a processor that excites the coils and processes the received signals, optional position sensors for external reference, and an electrode on the distal tip for delivering ablative energy. The claims describe various embodiments of coil arrangements, the method of generating and detecting magnetic fields, and the use of the measured tip position to control tissue treatment.\n\n1.

    "reasoning": "The high‑sensitivity pressure‑sensing probe already discloses a magnetic‑field‑based joint sensor with a resilient joint that deforms under pressure, a processor that excites coils and processes the resulting signals, and the use of magnetic transducers to infer tip displacement and pressure. The claimed invention differs mainly in replacing one of the active coils with an electrically passive element (e.g., a permanent magnet) and arranging the coil and passive element in separate portions of the shaft so that relative movement caused by deformation of a flexible member changes the coil’s electrical characteristic. Such a substitution of a passive magnet for an active coil is a known technique in inductive sensing and would be motivated by the desire to simplify the sensor, reduce power consumption and improve reliability – advantages that a skilled practitioner would reasonably expect. Consequently, the prior art provides a clear basis for modifying the disclosed sensor arrangement to achieve the claimed features, giving the skilled person a motivation to do so. Therefore, the invention would be arrived at by modifying the closest prior art.",

It features an elongate tubular shaft with proximal and distal sections separated by a flexible member of known stiffness. A first electromagnetic coil and a first electrically passive element (e.g., a material that affects the coil’s electrical properties) are placed at different locations along the shaft. When the distal tip contacts tissue, the flexible member deforms, causing relative movement between the coil and the passive element. This movement alters the coil’s electrical characteristic, producing a signal that indicates both the amount of deformation and the contact force. In the system embodiment, an electronic control unit excites the coil and measures the change to determine a specific force magnitude.\nAnswer 'yes' or 'no' only (y/n):",

    "question": "[Q58] Is the invention a result of a simple, straightforward extrapolation from the known art?\nAnswer 'yes' or 'no' only (y/n):",
    "answer": "n",
    "reasoning": "The claimed device differs from the known art in several non‑obvious ways. The closest prior art (the high‑sensitivity pressure‑sensing probe) discloses magnetic transducers (coils) on opposite sides of a joint, both of which are active coils. The invention, however, places a first electromagnetic coil in a proximal portion of the shaft and a *passive* element (e.g., a permanent magnet or other material) in the distal portion, such that relative movement caused by deformation of a flexible member changes the coil’s electrical characteristic. This specific spatial separation and the use of a passive element to modulate the coil’s inductance are not taught or suggested by D2, D4, D6 or the probe document. Moreover, the claim requires the coil to be \"adapted for creating a magnetic field\" (or to be both electrically excited and transmitting signals) and an electronic control unit that excites the coil and measures the change – features not disclosed in the prior art. The prior art does not provide a straightforward teaching to replace one of the active coils with a passive element or to relocate the coil to a proximal shaft portion for the purpose of measuring contact force. Consequently, the invention cannot be regarded as a simple, routine extrapolation from the known art; it involves a novel functional arrangement that was not obvious to the skilled person.",
