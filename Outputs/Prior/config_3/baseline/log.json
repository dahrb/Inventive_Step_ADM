    "answer": "No",
    "reasoning": "Step 1 – Identify the closest prior art.  The \"High‑sensitivity pressure‑sensing probe\" (US patent) discloses a medical probe with an insertion tube, a distal tip, a joint (flexible member) and a joint sensor comprising magnetic transducers (coils) on opposite sides of the joint.  The transducers can be driven by a current to generate a magnetic field and the sensor detects the relative position of the joint, which is used to infer the pressure exerted on the tip.  This disclosure is the closest to claim 1 of the patent in suit because it teaches the same overall purpose (force/pressure sensing in a catheter‑like device) and the same functional elements (shaft, flexible member, magnetic sensing element).\n\nStep 2 – Compare the claim features with the closest prior art.  Claim 1 requires:\n- an elongate tubular shaft with proximal and distal portions capable of axial movement and deflection (disclosed in the probe of the prior art);\n- a flexible member (the joint) between the two portions (disclosed);\n- a first electromagnetic coil disposed in the shaft (the magnetic transducer of the prior art);\n- a first electrically passive element disposed in the shaft, the material of which affects the electrical characteristic of the coil (the prior art does not expressly name a \"passive\" element, but the joint sensor of the prior art uses two magnetic transducers on opposite sides of the joint; the magnetic coupling between them is altered by joint deformation, which is functionally equivalent to a coil whose inductance is altered by a nearby passive magnetic body);\n- relative movement between the coil and the passive element caused by deformation of the flexible member, producing a change in the coil’s electrical characteristic that indicates deformation and contact force (the prior art teaches that deformation of the joint changes the magnetic coupling between the two transducers, which is measured as a change in the electrical signal of the driven coil).  Thus, all essential features are either explicitly disclosed or are directly derivable from the prior art.\n\nStep 3 – Identify distinguishing features.  The only apparent difference is that claim 1 specifies that the coil is \"adapted for creating a magnetic field\" and that the second element is \"electrically passive\" (i.e. not a second driven coil).  In the prior art the transducers are both coils, but it is well‑known in magnetic sensing to replace one active coil with a permanent magnet or a ferromagnetic piece to obtain the same change‑in‑inductance effect while reducing power consumption.  Such a substitution is a routine design optimisation for a skilled engineer.\n\nStep 4 – Formulate the objective technical problem.  The problem is to provide a catheter‑type device that measures the contact force between the distal tip and tissue more reliably/accurately, thereby reducing the risk of injury.\n\nStep 5 – Assess obviousness.  The prior art already teaches magnetic sensing of joint deformation (US‑probe).  It also teaches that the magnetic transducers can be placed on opposite sides of the joint (D2, D4) and that the coil can be located in a proximal portion while the sensing element is located distally (D6).  A skilled person, seeking to improve the device, would readily consider replacing one of the two driven coils with a passive magnetic element to simplify the electronics and to place the active coil where it can be easily driven (proximal shaft).  This modification would be motivated by the desire for lower power consumption and higher reliability – exactly the technical problem.  No teaching suggests that such a change would produce an unexpected technical effect; the expected result is simply the same force‑sensing function with the advantages sought.  Consequently, the solution would have been obvious to the skilled person in view of the combined teachings of the cited documents.\n\nStep 6 – Consider secondary indications.  The appeal file contains no evidence of unexpected technical results, commercial success, or long‑unexplored problem solving.  Therefore, no secondary factor overturns the obviousness conclusion.\n\nConclusion – Because all essential features are disclosed or would have been obvious to combine from the prior art, the subject‑matter of claim 1 (and consequently of the auxiliary requests) does not involve an inventive step under Article 56 EPC.\n\nAnswer: No",
