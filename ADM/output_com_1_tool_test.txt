The only teaching in D1 is to use the maximum data rate; D1 does not disclose, suggest or motivate the storage of a lower \u2018available\u2019 rate nor the use of that rate for transmission. No other document or teaching is supplied that would lead the skilled person to replace the maximum\u2011rate transmission with a lower, dynamically\u2011available rate. Consequently, the modifications are not rendered obvious by D1 alone, and, in the absence of any further teaching, the claimed subject\u2011matter involves an inventive step under the European Patent Convention.", "answer": "The claim is inventive over D1; it involves an inventive step."}

Step (ii): As a suitable starting point, document D1, which discloses a method of order management in which a server computer receives location information from GPS terminals, is selected as the closest prior art.

--- PATENT CLAIMS ---
Claim 1:

A computer-implemented method for brokering offers and demands in the field of transporting freight, comprising the following steps:

(a)
receiving transportation offers/demands from users, including location and time data;

(b)
receiving current location information of the users from GPS terminals with which the users are equipped;

(c)
after receiving a new offer/demand request, verifying if there are previous offers/demands not yet satisfied that can respond to the new request;

(d)
if so, selecting the one for which the current locations of both users are closest; and

(e)
otherwise storing the new request.

HISTORY:
USER: 
ASSISTANT: {"reasoning": "The closest prior art (document D1) is described only as a method of order management in which a server computer receives location information from GPS terminals. The claim, however, recites a specific computer\u2011implemented method for brokering freight transport offers and demands that includes: (a) receiving offers/demands together with location and time data; (b) receiving current GPS locations of the users; (c) checking whether there are previously received but unsatisfied offers/demands that could satisfy a new request; (d) if such offers/demands exist, selecting the one whose users are geographically closest; and (e) otherwise storing the new request. None of these additional functional steps (verification of unsatisfied requests, selection based on closest current locations, and conditional storage) are disclosed in D1. Because the only disclosed feature in D1 is the receipt of GPS location data, the claim adds further technical features that are not directly or implicitly taught by D1.

Step (ii): Document D1 discloses a method for the control of a thermal spray coating process by applying material to a workpiece using a spray jet, detecting deviations in the properties of the particles in said spray jet and adjusting process parameters automatically on the basis of the outcome of a neural network analysis. This document represents the closest prior art.

Step (iii): The difference between the method of claim 1 and D1 concerns the use of a neuro-fuzzy controller combining a neural network and fuzzy logic rules as specified in the second part of step (d).

--- PATENT CLAIMS ---
Claim 1:

A method for coating a workpiece using a thermal spray coating process, the method comprising:

(a)
applying, using a spray jet, a material to the workpiece by thermal spray coating;

(b)
monitoring the thermal spray coating process in real time by detecting properties of particles in the spray jet and supplying the properties as actual values;

(c)
comparing the actual values with target values;

and, in the event that the actual values deviate from the target values,

(d)
adjusting process parameters for the thermal spray coating process automatically by a controller on the basis of a neural network, said controller being a neuro-fuzzy controller which combines a neural-network and fuzzy logic rules and thereby maps statistical relationships between input variables and output variables of the neuro-fuzzy controller

[LLM RESPONSE]:
{
  "reasoning": "The closest prior art D1 discloses a method where a mobile user selects a single product, the server determines the nearest vendor and sends this information to the device. The claimed invention differs from D1 in three respects: (1) the user may select two or more products; (2) the server provides an \"optimal shopping tour\" covering all selected products; and (3) the optimal tour is obtained by consulting a cache that stores tours previously computed. \n\nUnder the EPO problem‑solution approach, the technical problem can be formulated as providing a method that enables a mobile user to purchase several selected products in a single, efficient trip, while reducing the computational effort required to determine such a trip. \n\nBoth handling multiple items and determining an optimal route (a travelling‑salesman‑type problem) are well‑known in the art. Routing and logistics literature, as well as numerous computer‑science publications, teach that when several destinations must be visited, an optimal tour can be calculated. The use of a cache (or memoisation) to store previously computed routes to avoid recalculating them is a routine optimisation known to skilled programmers for improving performance of routing algorithms. \n\nConsequently, a person skilled in the art, starting from D1 and seeking to extend the single‑product nearest‑vendor function to a multi‑product scenario, would readily combine the known teaching of multi‑item selection with the known techniques for route optimisation and caching. The combination does not produce any unexpected technical effect beyond the obvious advantages of reduced computation time and a more convenient user experience, which are themselves predictable. Therefore, the subject‑matter of claim 1 lacks an inventive step under Article 56 EPC.\n\nConclusion: The claim is obvious and does not involve an inventive step.",

Step (ii): Document D1, which discloses a method for facilitating shopping on a mobile device wherein the user selects a single product and the server determines from a database the vendor selling the selected product nearest to the user and transmits this information to the mobile device, is selected as the closest prior art.

Step (iii): The differences between the subject-matter of claim 1 and D1 are:

(1)
The user can select two or more products to purchase (instead of a single product only). 

(2)
An "optimal shopping tour" for purchasing the two or more products is provided to the user. 

(3)
The optimal shopping tour is determined by the server by accessing a cache memory in which optimal shopping tours determined for previous requests are stored.

HISTORY:
USER: 
ASSISTANT: {"reasoning": "The closest prior art (D1) already discloses a method in which a mobile user selects a product, the server determines the nearest vendor and transmits this information. The distinguishing features of claim\u202f1 are: (1) the user may select two or more products; (2) the server provides an \"optimal shopping tour\" for purchasing the selected products; and (3) the optimal tour is obtained by consulting a cache that stores tours previously computed. \n\nApplying the EPO problem\u2011solution approach, the technical problem can be formulated as: \"How to enable a mobile user to purchase several selected products in a single, efficient trip to the relevant vendors.\" \n\nBoth the idea of handling multiple items and the concept of determining an optimal route are well\u2011known in the art (e.g., routing, travelling\u2011salesman and logistics literature). The use of a cache to store pre\u2011computed routes is a routine computer\u2011science optimisation that a skilled person would readily consider to improve performance. Consequently, the combination of these features would have been obvious to a person skilled in the art seeking to extend D1\u2019s single\u2011product nearest\u2011vendor function to a multi\u2011product scenario. No technical effect beyond the known advantages of reduced computation time is demonstrated. Therefore, the subject\u2011matter of claim\u202f1 lacks an inventive step under Article\u202f56 EPC.\n\nConclusion: The claim is obvious and does not involve an inventive step.", "answer": "The claim does not involve an inventive step (it is obvious)."}
USER: 
ASSISTANT: {"reasoning": "The closest prior art D1 discloses a method where a mobile user selects a single product, the server determines the nearest vendor and sends this information to the device. The claimed invention differs from D1 in three respects: (1) the user may select two or more products; (2) the server provides an \"optimal shopping tour\" covering all selected products; and (3) the optimal tour is obtained by consulting a cache that stores tours previously computed. \n\nUnder the EPO problem\u2011solution approach, the technical problem can be formulated as providing a method that enables a mobile user to purchase several selected products in a single, efficient trip, while reducing the computational effort required to determine such a trip. \n\nBoth handling multiple items and determining an optimal route (a travelling\u2011salesman\u2011type problem) are well\u2011known in the art. Routing and logistics literature, as well as numerous computer\u2011science publications, teach that when several destinations must be visited, an optimal tour can be calculated. The use of a cache (or memoisation) to store previously computed routes to avoid recalculating them is a routine optimisation known to skilled programmers for improving performance of routing algorithms. \n\nConsequently, a person skilled in the art, starting from D1 and seeking to extend the single\u2011product nearest\u2011vendor function to a multi\u2011product scenario, would readily combine the known teaching of multi\u2011item selection with the known techniques for route optimisation and caching. The combination does not produce any unexpected technical effect beyond the obvious advantages of reduced computation time and a more convenient user experience, which are themselves predictable.

Step (ii): Document D1, which discloses a system for broadcasting video over an xDSL connection to the set-top boxes of subscribers, is selected as the closest prior art. The system comprises a database storing identifiers of subscribers' computers and, in association with them, an indication of the maximum data rate for the data connection to each subscriber's computer. The system further comprises means for transmitting the video to a subscriber's computer at the maximum data rate stored for said computer.

Step (iii): The differences between the subject-matter of claim 1 and D1 are:

(1) 
Storing an indication of an available data rate of the data connection to the remote client, said available data rate being lower than the maximum data rate for the data connection to the remote client. 

(2) 
Using said available data rate to determine the rate at which the data is transmitted to the remote client (instead of transmitting the data at the maximum data rate stored for said remote client as in D1).

--- CLOSEST PRIOR ART ---
Step (ii): Document D1, which discloses a method for facilitating shopping on a mobile device wherein the user selects a single product and the server determines from a database the vendor selling the selected product nearest to the user and transmits this information to the mobile device, is selected as the closest prior art.

Step (iii): The differences between the subject-matter of claim 1 and D1 are:

(1)
The user can select two or more products to purchase (instead of a single product only). 

(2)
An "optimal shopping tour" for purchasing the two or more products is provided to the user. 

(3)
The optimal shopping tour is determined by the server by accessing a cache memory in which optimal shopping tours determined for previous requests are stored. 

--- PATENT CLAIMS ---
Claim 1:

Method of facilitating shopping on a mobile device wherein:

(a)
the user selects two or more products to be purchased;

(b)
the mobile device transmits the selected products data and the device location to a server;

(c)
the server accesses a database of vendors to identify vendors offering at least one of the selected products;

(d)
the server determines, on the basis of the device location and the identified vendors, an optimal shopping tour for purchasing the selected products by accessing a cache memory in which optimal shopping tours determined for previous requests are stored; and

(e)
the server transmits the optimal shopping tour to the mobile device for displaying.

HISTORY:
USER: 
ASSISTANT: {"reasoning": "The closest prior art (D1) already discloses a method in which a mobile user selects a product, the server determines the nearest vendor and transmits this information. The distinguishing features of claim\u202f1 are: (1) the user may select two or more products; (2) the server provides an \"optimal shopping tour\" for purchasing the selected products; and (3) the optimal tour is obtained by consulting a cache that stores tours previously computed. \n\nApplying the EPO problem\u2011solution approach, the technical problem can be formulated as: \"How to enable a mobile user to purchase several selected products in a single, efficient trip to the relevant vendors.\" \n\nBoth the idea of handling multiple items and the concept of determining an optimal route are well\u2011known in the art (e.g., routing, travelling\u2011salesman and logistics literature). The use of a cache to store pre\u2011computed routes is a routine computer\u2011science optimisation that a skilled person would readily consider to improve performance. Consequently, the combination of these features would have been obvious to a person skilled in the art seeking to extend D1\u2019s single\u2011product nearest\u2011vendor function to a multi\u2011product scenario. No technical effect beyond the known advantages of reduced computation time is demonstrated. Therefore, the subject\u2011matter of claim\u202f1 lacks an inventive step under Article\u202f56 EPC.\n\nConclusion: The claim is obvious and does not involve an inventive step.", "answer": "The claim does not involve an inventive step (it is obvious)."}
USER: 
ASSISTANT: {"reasoning": "The closest prior art D1 discloses a method where a mobile user selects a single product, the server determines the nearest vendor and sends this information to the device. The claimed invention differs from D1 in three respects: (1) the user may select two or more products; (2) the server provides an \"optimal shopping tour\" covering all selected products; and (3) the optimal tour is obtained by consulting a cache that stores tours previously computed. \n\nUnder the EPO problem\u2011solution approach, the technical problem can be formulated as providing a method that enables a mobile user to purchase several selected products in a single, efficient trip, while reducing the computational effort required to determine such a trip. \n\nBoth handling multiple items and determining an optimal route (a travelling\u2011salesman\u2011type problem) are well\u2011known in the art. Routing and logistics literature, as well as numerous computer\u2011science publications, teach that when several destinations must be visited, an optimal tour can be calculated. The use of a cache (or memoisation) to store previously computed routes to avoid recalculating them is a routine optimisation known to skilled programmers for improving performance of routing algorithms. \n\nConsequently, a person skilled in the art, starting from D1 and seeking to extend the single\u2011product nearest\u2011vendor function to a multi\u2011product scenario, would readily combine the known teaching of multi\u2011item selection with the known techniques for route optimisation and caching. The combination does not produce any unexpected technical effect beyond the obvious advantages of reduced computation time and a more convenient user experience, which are themselves predictable. Therefore, the subject\u2011matter of claim 1 lacks an inventive step under Article 56 EPC.\n\nConclusion: The claim is obvious and does not involve an inventive step.", "answer": "The claim does not involve an inventive step (it is obvious)."}

USER: 
ASSISTANT: {"reasoning": "The closest prior art (D1) discloses a system that stores, for each subscriber, an identifier and the maximum data rate of the DSL connection, and then transmits video at that maximum rate. The claimed invention differs from D1 in two respects: (1) it stores an indication of an *available* data rate that is lower than the maximum data rate, and (2) it determines the transmission rate based on this available data rate rather than the maximum rate. The problem\u2011solution approach therefore is: (i) identify D1 as the closest prior art; (ii) define the technical problem as providing a broadcast transmission that adapts to the actual bandwidth that can be used at a given moment, avoiding overload of the connection; (iii) assess whether the skilled person would arrive at the claimed features in an obvious manner. The only teaching in D1 is to use the maximum data rate; D1 does not disclose, suggest or motivate the storage of a lower \u2018available\u2019 rate nor the use of that rate for transmission. No other document or teaching is supplied that would lead the skilled person to replace the maximum\u2011rate transmission with a lower, dynamically\u2011available rate.

HISTORY:
USER: 
ASSISTANT: {"reasoning": "The closest prior art (D1) discloses a system that stores, for each subscriber, an identifier and the maximum data rate of the DSL connection and then transmits video at that maximum rate. The claimed invention differs from D1 in two respects: (1) it stores an indication of an *available* data rate that is lower than the maximum data rate, and (2) it determines the transmission rate based on this available data rate rather than the maximum rate. The technical effect of these features is that the system can adapt the transmission rate to the actual bandwidth that can be used at a given moment, avoiding overload of the connection and potentially improving quality of service. \n\nApplying the EPO problem\u2011solution approach:\n1. **Closest prior art** \u2013 D1 is correctly identified.\n2. **Objective technical problem** \u2013 Provide a broadcast transmission method that adapts to the real\u2011time bandwidth that is actually available on the subscriber\u2019s DSL line, rather than always using the nominal maximum rate.\n3. **Inventive step assessment** \u2013 D1 teaches only the use of the maximum data rate stored for each subscriber. It does not disclose, suggest or motivate the storage of a lower \u2018available\u2019 rate nor the use of that rate for determining the transmission speed. No further teaching is supplied in the case data that would lead the skilled person to replace the maximum\u2011rate transmission with a lower, dynamically\u2011available rate. Consequently, the modifications are not obvious to the person skilled in the art based on D1 alone. \nTherefore, the subject\u2011matter of claim 1 involves an inventive step under the European Patent Convention.", "answer": "The claim is inventive over D1; it involves an inventive step."}

Step (ii): Document D1, which discloses a method for facilitating shopping on a mobile device wherein the user selects a single product and the server determines from a database the vendor selling the selected product nearest to the user and transmits this information to the mobile device, is selected as the closest prior art.

Step (iii): The differences between the subject-matter of claim 1 and D1 are:

(1)
The user can select two or more products to purchase (instead of a single product only). 

(2)
An "optimal shopping tour" for purchasing the two or more products is provided to the user. 

(3)
The optimal shopping tour is determined by the server by accessing a cache memory in which optimal shopping tours determined for previous requests are stored.

Method of facilitating shopping on a mobile device wherein:

(a)
the user selects two or more products to be purchased;

(b)
the mobile device transmits the selected products data and the device location to a server;

HISTORY:
USER: 
ASSISTANT: {"reasoning": "The closest prior art D1 discloses a method where a mobile user selects a single product, the server determines the nearest vendor and sends this information to the device. The claimed invention differs from D1 in three respects: (1) the user may select two or more products; (2) the server provides an \"optimal shopping tour\" covering all selected products; and (3) the optimal tour is obtained by consulting a cache that stores tours previously computed. \n\nUnder the EPO problem\u2011solution approach, the technical problem can be formulated as providing a method that enables a mobile user to purchase several selected products in a single, efficient trip, while reducing the computational effort required to determine such a trip. \n\nBoth handling multiple items and determining an optimal route (a travelling\u2011salesman\u2011type problem) are well\u2011known in the art. Routing and logistics literature, as well as numerous computer\u2011science publications, teach that when several destinations must be visited, an optimal tour can be calculated. The use of a cache (or memoisation) to store previously computed routes to avoid recalculating them is a routine optimisation known to skilled programmers for improving performance of routing algorithms. \n\nConsequently, a person skilled in the art, starting from D1 and seeking to extend the single\u2011product nearest\u2011vendor function to a multi\u2011product scenario, would readily combine the known teaching of multi\u2011item selection with the known techniques for route optimisation and caching. The combination does not produce any unexpected technical effect beyond the obvious advantages of reduced computation time and a more convenient user experience, which are themselves predictable. Therefore, the subject\u2011matter of claim 1 lacks an inventive step under Article 56 EPC.\n\nConclusion: The claim is obvious and does not involve an inventive step.", "answer": "The claim does not involve an inventive step (it is obvious)."}

{
  "reasoning": "The closest prior art (D1) is described only as a method of order management in which a server computer receives location information from GPS terminals. The patent claim 1 adds several further steps that are not mentioned in D1: (a) receiving transportation offers or demands that include location and time data; (b) after a new request arrives, checking whether there are earlier unsatisfied offers or demands that could satisfy it; (c) if such offers/demands exist, selecting the one whose current user locations are closest; and (d) otherwise storing the new request. Because D1 is limited to the receipt of GPS location data, it does not disclose any of these additional functional features. Under the EPO problem‑solution approach, the distinguishing features are the verification of pending requests, the proximity‑based selection, and the fallback storage step. The technical effect of these features is a more efficient matching of freight transport offers and demands based on real‑time proximity, which is not achieved by D1.

--- CLOSEST PRIOR ART ---
Step (ii): As a suitable starting point, document D1, which discloses a method of order management in which a server computer receives location information from GPS terminals, is selected as the closest prior art.

--- PATENT CLAIMS ---
Claim 1:

A computer-implemented method for brokering offers and demands in the field of transporting freight, comprising the following steps:

(a)
receiving transportation offers/demands from users, including location and time data;

(b)
receiving current location information of the users from GPS terminals with which the users are equipped;

(c)
after receiving a new offer/demand request, verifying if there are previous offers/demands not yet satisfied that can respond to the new request;

(d)
if so, selecting the one for which the current locations of both users are closest; and

(e)
otherwise storing the new request.

USER: 
ASSISTANT: {"reasoning": "The closest prior art (D1) is described only as a method of order management in which a server computer receives location information from GPS terminals. The patent claim 1 adds several further steps that are not mentioned in D1: (a) receiving transportation offers or demands that include location and time data; (b) after a new request arrives, checking whether there are earlier unsatisfied offers or demands that could satisfy it; (c) if such offers/demands exist, selecting the one whose current user locations are closest; and (d) otherwise storing the new request. Because D1 is limited to the receipt of GPS location data, it does not disclose any of these additional functional features. Under the EPO problem\u2011solution approach, the distinguishing features are the verification of pending requests, the proximity\u2011based selection, and the fallback storage step. The technical effect of these features is a more efficient matching of freight transport offers and demands based on real\u2011time proximity, which is not achieved by D1. Assuming that the skilled person would not combine D1 with other teachings to arrive at the same combination in an obvious manner (no such combination is provided in the case data), the claim appears to involve an inventive step over D1.", "answer": "Based on the information provided, claim 1 contains features that are not disclosed in the closest prior art D1. The additional steps of handling offers/demands, checking for unsatisfied prior requests, selecting the closest match, and storing unmatched requests provide a technical effect (improved matching of freight transport based on real\u2011time proximity) that is not taught by D1. Consequently, the claim is likely to involve an inventive step under the EPO assessment."}

Step (ii): As a suitable starting point, document D1, which discloses a method of order management in which a server computer receives location information from GPS terminals, is selected as the closest prior art.

--- PATENT CLAIMS ---
Claim 1:

A computer-implemented method for brokering offers and demands in the field of transporting freight, comprising the following steps:

(a)
receiving transportation offers/demands from users, including location and time data;

(b)
receiving current location information of the users from GPS terminals with which the users are equipped;

(c)
after receiving a new offer/demand request, verifying if there are previous offers/demands not yet satisfied that can respond to the new request;

(d)
if so, selecting the one for which the current locations of both users are closest; and

(e)
otherwise storing the new request.

USER: 
ASSISTANT: {"reasoning": "The closest prior art (D1) is described only as a method of order management in which a server computer receives location information from GPS terminals. The patent claim 1 adds several further steps that are not mentioned in D1: (a) receiving transportation offers or demands that include location and time data; (b) after a new request arrives, checking whether there are earlier unsatisfied offers or demands that could satisfy it; (c) if such offers/demands exist, selecting the one whose current user locations are closest; and (d) otherwise storing the new request. Because D1 is limited to the receipt of GPS location data, it does not disclose any of these additional functional features. Under the EPO problem\u2011solution approach, the distinguishing features are the verification of pending requests, the proximity\u2011based selection, and the fallback storage step. The technical effect of these features is a more efficient matching of freight transport offers and demands based on real\u2011time proximity, which is not achieved by D1. Assuming that the skilled person would not combine D1 with other teachings to arrive at the same combination in an obvious manner (no such combination is provided in the case data), the claim appears to involve an inventive step over D1.", "answer": "Based on the information provided, claim 1 contains features that are not disclosed in the closest prior art D1. The additional steps of handling offers/demands, checking for unsatisfied prior requests, selecting the closest match, and storing unmatched requests provide a technical effect (improved matching of freight transport based on real\u2011time proximity) that is not taught by D1. Consequently, the claim is likely to involve an inventive step under the EPO assessment."}

  "reasoning": "The closest prior art (D1) already discloses a system that stores, for each subscriber, an identifier and the maximum data rate of the DSL connection, and transmits video at that maximum rate. The claimed invention differs from D1 in two respects: (1) it stores an indication of an *available* data rate that is lower than the maximum data rate, and (2) it uses this available data rate to determine the transmission rate, rather than always using the maximum rate.\n\nApplying the EPO problem‑solution approach, the technical problem can be formulated as: how to avoid transmitting video at a rate that exceeds the actually usable bandwidth of the connection, thereby preventing congestion or quality degradation. A skilled person faced with this problem would be aware that the maximum data rate stored in D1 does not necessarily reflect the real‑time capacity of the DSL line, which can be reduced by network load, line noise, or other impairments. It is common general knowledge in the field of broadband video delivery that adaptive bitrate streaming or rate‑control mechanisms are used to match the transmission rate to the current available bandwidth.\n\nConsequently, the modification of storing an \"available\" data rate (e.g., measured or estimated from the connection) and using it to set the transmission rate would be an obvious implementation of that general knowledge. No teaching or suggestion in D1 or the common knowledge is required to replace the fixed‑rate transmission by a rate that reflects the lower, currently available bandwidth. Therefore, the claimed features (1) and (2) would be considered obvious to the skilled person, and the claim lacks an inventive step under Article 56 EPC.\n\nThus, the subject‑matter of claim 1 does not involve an inventive step over D1.",

Step (ii): Document D1, which discloses a system for broadcasting video over an xDSL connection to the set-top boxes of subscribers, is selected as the closest prior art. The system comprises a database storing identifiers of subscribers' computers and, in association with them, an indication of the maximum data rate for the data connection to each subscriber's computer. The system further comprises means for transmitting the video to a subscriber's computer at the maximum data rate stored for said computer.

Step (iii): The differences between the subject-matter of claim 1 and D1 are:

(1) 
Storing an indication of an available data rate of the data connection to the remote client, said available data rate being lower than the maximum data rate for the data connection to the remote client. 

(2) 
Using said available data rate to determine the rate at which the data is transmitted to the remote client (instead of transmitting the data at the maximum data rate stored for said remote client as in D1). 

--- PATENT CLAIMS ---
Claim 1:

A system for the transmission of a broadcast media channel to a remote client over a data connection, said system including:

USER: 
ASSISTANT: {"reasoning": "The closest prior art (D1) already discloses a system that stores, for each subscriber, an identifier and the maximum data rate of the DSL connection, and transmits video at that maximum rate. The claimed invention differs from D1 in two respects: (1) it stores an indication of an *available* data rate that is lower than the maximum data rate, and (2) it uses this available data rate to determine the transmission rate, rather than always using the maximum rate.\n\nApplying the EPO problem\u2011solution approach, the technical problem can be formulated as: how to avoid transmitting video at a rate that exceeds the actually usable bandwidth of the connection, thereby preventing congestion or quality degradation. A skilled person faced with this problem would be aware that the maximum data rate stored in D1 does not necessarily reflect the real\u2011time capacity of the DSL line, which can be reduced by network load, line noise, or other impairments. It is common general knowledge in the field of broadband video delivery that adaptive bitrate streaming or rate\u2011control mechanisms are used to match the transmission rate to the current available bandwidth.\n\nConsequently, the modification of storing an \"available\" data rate (e.g., measured or estimated from the connection) and using it to set the transmission rate would be an obvious implementation of that general knowledge. No teaching or suggestion in D1 or the common knowledge is required to replace the fixed\u2011rate transmission by a rate that reflects the lower, currently available bandwidth. Therefore, the claimed features (1) and (2) would be considered obvious to the skilled person, and the claim lacks an inventive step under Article 56 EPC.\n\nThus, the subject\u2011matter of claim 1 does not involve an inventive step over D1.", "answer": "The claim does not involve an inventive step; the differences over D1 (storing an available data rate lower than the maximum and using it to set the transmission rate) would be obvious to a skilled person."}

  "reasoning": "Applying the EPO problem‑solution approach, the closest prior art (D1) already discloses a method in which a mobile device sends a selected product and the device location to a server, the server accesses a vendor database, determines the nearest vendor and returns this information to the device. \n\nThe distinguishing features of claim 1 are: (1) the user may select two or more products; (2) the server determines an \"optimal shopping tour\" for purchasing the selected products; and (3) the optimal tour is derived by consulting a cache that stores tours previously computed for other requests.\n\n1. **Selection of multiple products** – Extending a system that works for a single product to handle several products is a straightforward generalisation that a skilled person would consider obvious. The underlying mechanisms (transmission of product data, location, database lookup) remain the same; only the quantity of items changes.\n\n2. **Optimal shopping tour** – The problem of planning a route that visits several locations in an efficient order is a well‑known problem in logistics and computer science (the travelling‑salesman/vehicle‑routing problem). The skilled person, faced with the need to purchase several items, would naturally look to known route‑optimisation techniques to compute a tour that minimises distance or time.

A skilled person would therefore consider it obvious to store earlier tours and reuse them when similar requests arise, especially to reduce computational load.\n\nBecause each distinguishing feature would have been obvious to a person skilled in the art starting from D1, and the combination of these features does not produce a synergistic effect that yields a technical contribution beyond the sum of the parts, the subject‑matter of claim 1 lacks an inventive step under Article 56 EPC.\n\n**Conclusion:** Claim 1 does not involve an inventive step over D1; it is obvious and therefore not patent‑eligible under the EPO standards.",

--- CLOSEST PRIOR ART ---
Step (ii): Document D1, which discloses a system for broadcasting video over an xDSL connection to the set-top boxes of subscribers, is selected as the closest prior art. The system comprises a database storing identifiers of subscribers' computers and, in association with them, an indication of the maximum data rate for the data connection to each subscriber's computer. The system further comprises means for transmitting the video to a subscriber's computer at the maximum data rate stored for said computer.

Step (iii): The differences between the subject-matter of claim 1 and D1 are:

(1) 
Storing an indication of an available data rate of the data connection to the remote client, said available data rate being lower than the maximum data rate for the data connection to the remote client. 

(2) 
Using said available data rate to determine the rate at which the data is transmitted to the remote client (instead of transmitting the data at the maximum data rate stored for said remote client as in D1). 

--- PATENT CLAIMS ---
Claim 1:

A system for the transmission of a broadcast media channel to a remote client over a data connection, said system including:

(a)
means for storing an identifier of the remote client and an indication of an available data rate of the data connection to the remote client, said available data rate being lower than the maximum data rate for the data connection to the remote client;

(b)
means for determining a rate at which data is to be transmitted based on the indication of the available data rate of the data connection; and

(c)
means for transmitting data at the determined rate to said remote clien

USER: 
ASSISTANT: {"reasoning": "The closest prior art (D1) already discloses a system that stores, for each subscriber, an identifier and the maximum data rate of the DSL connection, and transmits video at that maximum rate. The claimed invention differs from D1 in two respects: (1) it stores an indication of an *available* data rate that is lower than the maximum data rate, and (2) it uses this available data rate to determine the transmission rate, rather than always using the maximum rate.\n\nApplying the EPO problem\u2011solution approach, the technical problem can be formulated as: how to avoid transmitting video at a rate that exceeds the actually usable bandwidth of the connection, thereby preventing congestion or quality degradation. A skilled person faced with this problem would be aware that the maximum data rate stored in D1 does not necessarily reflect the real\u2011time capacity of the DSL line, which can be reduced by network load, line noise, or other impairments. It is common general knowledge in the field of broadband video delivery that adaptive bitrate streaming or rate\u2011control mechanisms are used to match the transmission rate to the current available bandwidth.\n\nConsequently, the modification of storing an \"available\" data rate (e.g., measured or estimated from the connection) and using it to set the transmission rate would be an obvious implementation of that general knowledge. No teaching or suggestion in D1 or the common knowledge is required to replace the fixed\u2011rate transmission by a rate that reflects the lower, currently available bandwidth. Therefore, the claimed features (1) and (2) would be considered obvious to the skilled person, and the claim lacks an inventive step under Article 56 EPC.\n\nThus, the subject\u2011matter of claim 1 does not involve an inventive step over D1.", "answer": "The claim does not involve an inventive step; the differences over D1 (storing an available data rate lower than the maximum and using it to set the transmission rate) would be obvious to a skilled person."}

Step (ii): Document D1, which discloses a system for broadcasting video over an xDSL connection to the set-top boxes of subscribers, is selected as the closest prior art. The system comprises a database storing identifiers of subscribers' computers and, in association with them, an indication of the maximum data rate for the data connection to each subscriber's computer. The system further comprises means for transmitting the video to a subscriber's computer at the maximum data rate stored for said computer.

Step (iii): The differences between the subject-matter of claim 1 and D1 are:

(1) 
Storing an indication of an available data rate of the data connection to the remote client, said available data rate being lower than the maximum data rate for the data connection to the remote client.

HISTORY:
USER: 
ASSISTANT: {"reasoning": "The closest prior art (D1) already discloses a system that stores, for each subscriber, an identifier and the maximum data rate of the DSL connection, and transmits video at that maximum rate. The claimed invention differs from D1 in two respects: (1) it stores an indication of an *available* data rate that is lower than the maximum data rate, and (2) it uses this available data rate to determine the transmission rate, rather than always using the maximum rate.\n\nApplying the EPO problem\u2011solution approach, the technical problem can be formulated as: how to avoid transmitting video at a rate that exceeds the actually usable bandwidth of the connection, thereby preventing congestion or quality degradation. A skilled person faced with this problem would be aware that the maximum data rate stored in D1 does not necessarily reflect the real\u2011time capacity of the DSL line, which can be reduced by network load, line noise, or other impairments. It is common general knowledge in the field of broadband video delivery that adaptive bitrate streaming or rate\u2011control mechanisms are used to match the transmission rate to the current available bandwidth.\n\nConsequently, the modification of storing an \"available\" data rate (e.g., measured or estimated from the connection) and using it to set the transmission rate would be an obvious implementation of that general knowledge. No teaching or suggestion in D1 or the common knowledge is required to replace the fixed\u2011rate transmission by a rate that reflects the lower, currently available bandwidth. Therefore, the claimed features (1) and (2) would be considered obvious to the skilled person, and the claim lacks an inventive step under Article 56 EPC.\n\nThus, the subject\u2011matter of claim 1 does not involve an inventive step over D1.", "answer": "The claim does not involve an inventive step; the differences over D1 (storing an available data rate lower than the maximum and using it to set the transmission rate) would be obvious to a skilled person."}

--- CLOSEST PRIOR ART ---
Step (ii): Document D1, which discloses a method for facilitating shopping on a mobile device wherein the user selects a single product and the server determines from a database the vendor selling the selected product nearest to the user and transmits this information to the mobile device, is selected as the closest prior art.

Step (iii): The differences between the subject-matter of claim 1 and D1 are:

HISTORY:
USER: 
ASSISTANT: {"reasoning": "Applying the EPO problem\u2011solution approach, the closest prior art (D1) already discloses a method in which a mobile device sends a selected product and the device location to a server, the server accesses a vendor database, determines the nearest vendor and returns this information to the device. \n\nThe distinguishing features of claim 1 are: (1) the user may select two or more products; (2) the server determines an \"optimal shopping tour\" for purchasing the selected products; and (3) the optimal tour is derived by consulting a cache that stores tours previously computed for other requests.\n\n1. **Selection of multiple products** \u2013 Extending a system that works for a single product to handle several products is a straightforward generalisation that a skilled person would consider obvious. The underlying mechanisms (transmission of product data, location, database lookup) remain the same; only the quantity of items changes.\n\n2. **Optimal shopping tour** \u2013 The problem of planning a route that visits several locations in an efficient order is a well\u2011known problem in logistics and computer science (the travelling\u2011salesman/vehicle\u2011routing problem). The skilled person, faced with the need to purchase several items, would naturally look to known route\u2011optimisation techniques to compute a tour that minimises distance or time. Thus, providing an \"optimal shopping tour\" is an obvious technical solution to the problem created by claim 1\u2019s first distinguishing feature.\n\n3. **Use of a cache of previously determined tours** \u2013 Caching previously computed solutions to speed up subsequent calculations is a common optimisation in software engineering and is taught in the literature on route\u2011planning algorithms. A skilled person would therefore consider it obvious to store earlier tours and reuse them when similar requests arise, especially to reduce computational load.\n\nBecause each distinguishing feature would have been obvious to a person skilled in the art starting from D1, and the combination of these features does not produce a synergistic effect that yields a technical contribution beyond the sum of the parts, the subject\u2011matter of claim 1 lacks an inventive step under Article 56 EPC.\n\n**Conclusion:** Claim 1 does not involve an inventive step over D1; it is obvious and therefore not patent\u2011eligible under the EPO standards.", "answer": "The subject\u2011matter of claim 1 lacks an inventive step (Article 56 EPC) over document D1; the differences (multiple products, optimal shopping tour, and use of a cache) would have been obvious to a skilled person."}

  "reasoning": "The claimed method in the patent application is word‑for‑word identical to the method disclosed in the closest prior art. Both describe the same sequence of steps (a)–(f): controlling an infrared camera to capture a temperature image of a surface; receiving mean indoor air temperature and relative humidity values measured over the last 24 hours; calculating a condensation temperature from those values; comparing each image point’s temperature to the calculated condensation temperature; identifying points with a temperature lower than that threshold as areas of increased condensation risk; and modifying the image by colouring those points to indicate the risk to a user. Because the entire subject‑matter of the claim is directly and unambiguously disclosed in the prior art, a person skilled in the art would find the claimed method obvious.

--- CLOSEST PRIOR ART ---
Step (ii): Document D1, which discloses a system for broadcasting video over an xDSL connection to the set-top boxes of subscribers, is selected as the closest prior art. The system comprises a database storing identifiers of subscribers' computers and, in association with them, an indication of the maximum data rate for the data connection to each subscriber's computer. The system further comprises means for transmitting the video to a subscriber's computer at the maximum data rate stored for said computer.

[LLM RESPONSE]:
{
  "reasoning": "The closest prior art (D1) already discloses a method for controlling a thermal spray coating process in which a neural network analyses particle‑property data in real time and automatically adjusts process parameters. The claimed method differs from D1 only in that the controller is specified as a \"neuro‑fuzzy controller\" that combines a neural network with fuzzy‑logic rules. \n\nFor an inventive step under the EPO approach, the question is whether the modification would have been obvious to the skilled person starting from D1. \n\n1. **Technical problem** – The problem solved by the amendment can be framed as providing an alternative controller that may offer smoother or more interpretable decision‑making by incorporating fuzzy‑logic rules together with the neural‑network model. \n2. **Known alternatives** – Both neural networks and fuzzy‑logic controllers are well‑known in the field of process control. The combination of the two, often called a neuro‑fuzzy system, is a standard technique in control engineering and is taught in the literature as a way to combine the learning capability of neural networks with the rule‑based reasoning of fuzzy logic. \n3. **Obviousness** – Starting from D1, a skilled person seeking to improve the controller would be aware of the existence of neuro‑fuzzy approaches and could readily replace the pure neural‑network controller with a neuro‑fuzzy one to obtain the claimed features. No technical teaching or unexpected effect is presented in the case data that would render the combination non‑obvious. \n4. **Conclusion** – Because the only distinguishing feature is the use of a neuro‑fuzzy controller, which would have been an obvious modification for a skilled person, the claimed method lacks an inventive step over D1.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the claim does not involve an inventive step under the EPO standards.",

Step (ii): Document D1 discloses a method for the control of a thermal spray coating process by applying material to a workpiece using a spray jet, detecting deviations in the properties of the particles in said spray jet and adjusting process parameters automatically on the basis of the outcome of a neural network analysis. This document represents the closest prior art.

Step (iii): The difference between the method of claim 1 and D1 concerns the use of a neuro-fuzzy controller combining a neural network and fuzzy logic rules as specified in the second part of step (d).

--- PATENT CLAIMS ---
Claim 1:

A method for coating a workpiece using a thermal spray coating process, the method comprising:

(a)
applying, using a spray jet, a material to the workpiece by thermal spray coating;

(b)
monitoring the thermal spray coating process in real time by detecting properties of particles in the spray jet and supplying the properties as actual values;

(c)
comparing the actual values with target values;

and, in the event that the actual values deviate from the target values,

(d)
adjusting process parameters for the thermal spray coating process automatically by a controller on the basis of a neural network, said controller being a neuro-fuzzy controller which combines a neural-network and fuzzy logic rules and thereby maps statistical relationships between input variables and output variables of the neuro-fuzzy controller

  "reasoning": "The closest prior art (D1) already discloses a system that stores, for each subscriber, an identifier and the maximum data rate of the DSL connection, and transmits video at that maximum rate. The claimed invention differs from D1 in two respects: (1) it stores an indication of an *available* data rate that is lower than the maximum data rate, and (2) it uses this available data rate to determine the transmission rate instead of always using the maximum rate.\n\nTo assess inventive step under the European Patent Convention (EPC), we apply the problem‑solution approach:\n\n1. **Determine the closest prior art** – D1 is correctly identified.\n2. **Establish the objective technical problem** – The problem can be formulated as “how to avoid over‑loading the data connection when the actual usable bandwidth is lower than the maximum capacity stored in the database”.\n3. **Identify the distinguishing features** – Storing an available (lower) data rate and using it to set the transmission rate.\n4. **Consider whether the skilled person would arrive at the solution in an obvious manner** – In the field of broadband video delivery, it is common knowledge that the maximum nominal DSL rate is not always achievable due to line conditions, congestion, or other temporary impairments. Adaptive bitrate streaming, congestion control, and dynamic rate adaptation are well‑known techniques in the art. A skilled person faced with the problem of preventing buffer underruns or excessive packet loss would naturally consider measuring or estimating the currently available bandwidth and adjusting the transmission rate accordingly.

No technical teaching or teaching away is present in D1 that would discourage such a modification.\n\nTherefore, the distinguishing features would have been obvious to the skilled person in view of D1 combined with the general knowledge of adaptive transmission in data networks.\n\n**Conclusion** – The subject‑matter of claim 1 lacks an inventive step (Article 56 EPC) over D1.",

  "reasoning": "The closest prior art (D1) discloses a method in which a mobile‑device user selects a single product, the server determines the nearest vendor for that product and sends the vendor information to the device. The subject‑matter of claim 1 differs from D1 in three respects:\n\n1. **Selection of two or more products** – D1 is limited to a single product. The claim expands the scope to a set of products, which changes the nature of the problem from locating a single vendor to planning a multi‑stop purchase.\n\n2. **Provision of an \"optimal shopping tour\"** – D1 only returns the nearest vendor for the selected product; it does not propose any route or sequence for acquiring multiple items. Determining an optimal tour (e.g., minimizing travel distance or time) introduces a new technical requirement that is not taught or suggested by D1.\n\n3. **Use of a cache memory storing previously determined optimal tours** – D1 contains no teaching about re‑using earlier computed routes. Accessing a cache to retrieve a pre‑computed optimal tour is a distinct technical feature that improves efficiency but is not disclosed or implied by D1.\n\nTo assess inventive step under the EPO approach, the skilled person would start from D1 and the identified problem (providing a convenient way for a user to purchase several selected items with minimal travel). The question is whether the skilled person, using common general knowledge, would have been motivated to modify D1 in the direction of the three differences in an obvious manner.\n\n* The move from a single‑product selection to multiple products is not a trivial extension. D1’s teaching is centred on the nearest‑vendor concept; it provides no guidance on handling a set of products or on how to combine vendor locations.\n\n* The notion of an \"optimal shopping tour\" involves solving a routing optimisation problem (akin to the travelling‑salesman problem). While routing optimisation is known in the art, D1 does not address it, nor does it suggest that the server should compute such a route for a shopping purpose. Introducing this feature therefore requires a non‑obvious technical contribution.\n\n* The use of a cache to store previously computed tours adds another layer of technical effect (reduced computation time, faster response). D1 does not disclose any caching mechanism, and there is no indication that the skilled person would combine caching with the routing idea in the specific context of mobile shopping.\n\nBecause none of the three distinguishing features are disclosed, suggested, or rendered obvious by D1, and because their combination yields a technical solution that solves the problem of efficiently purchasing multiple items, the subject‑matter of claim 1 involves an inventive step.\n\nHence, based strictly on the provided case data, claim 1 would be considered to involve an inventive step over D1.",

USER: 
ASSISTANT: {"reasoning": "The closest prior art (D1) already discloses a system that stores, for each subscriber, an identifier and the maximum data rate of the DSL connection, and transmits video at that maximum rate. The claimed invention differs from D1 in two respects: (1) it stores an indication of an *available* data rate that is lower than the maximum data rate, and (2) it uses this available data rate to determine the transmission rate instead of always using the maximum rate.\n\nTo assess inventive step under the European Patent Convention (EPC), we apply the problem\u2011solution approach:\n\n1. **Determine the closest prior art** \u2013 D1 is correctly identified.\n2. **Establish the objective technical problem** \u2013 The problem can be formulated as \u201chow to avoid over\u2011loading the data connection when the actual usable bandwidth is lower than the maximum capacity stored in the database\u201d.\n3. **Identify the distinguishing features** \u2013 Storing an available (lower) data rate and using it to set the transmission rate.\n4. **Consider whether the skilled person would arrive at the solution in an obvious manner** \u2013 In the field of broadband video delivery, it is common knowledge that the maximum nominal DSL rate is not always achievable due to line conditions, congestion, or other temporary impairments. Adaptive bitrate streaming, congestion control, and dynamic rate adaptation are well\u2011known techniques in the art. A skilled person faced with the problem of preventing buffer underruns or excessive packet loss would naturally consider measuring or estimating the currently available bandwidth and adjusting the transmission rate accordingly. The modification of D1 to store a lower, currently available rate instead of the static maximum, and to use that value for rate selection, does not require any teaching beyond what is generally known in the networking community. No technical teaching or teaching away is present in D1 that would discourage such a modification.\n\nTherefore, the distinguishing features would have been obvious to the skilled person in view of D1 combined with the general knowledge of adaptive transmission in data networks.\n\n**Conclusion** \u2013 The subject\u2011matter of claim 1 lacks an inventive step (Article 56 EPC) over D1.", "answer": "The claim does not involve an inventive step; the differences over D1 would have been obvious to a skilled person."}

Step (ii): Document D1, which discloses a method for facilitating shopping on a mobile device wherein the user selects a single product and the server determines from a database the vendor selling the selected product nearest to the user and transmits this information to the mobile device, is selected as the closest prior art.

Step (iii): The differences between the subject-matter of claim 1 and D1 are:

(1)
The user can select two or more products to purchase (instead of a single product only). 

(2)
An "optimal shopping tour" for purchasing the two or more products is provided to the user. 

(3)
The optimal shopping tour is determined by the server by accessing a cache memory in which optimal shopping tours determined for previous requests are stored.

USER: 
ASSISTANT: {"reasoning": "The closest prior art (D1) discloses a method in which a mobile\u2011device user selects a single product, the server determines the nearest vendor for that product and sends the vendor information to the device. The subject\u2011matter of claim\u202f1 differs from D1 in three respects:\n\n1. **Selection of two or more products** \u2013 D1 is limited to a single product. The claim expands the scope to a set of products, which changes the nature of the problem from locating a single vendor to planning a multi\u2011stop purchase.\n\n2. **Provision of an \"optimal shopping tour\"** \u2013 D1 only returns the nearest vendor for the selected product; it does not propose any route or sequence for acquiring multiple items. Determining an optimal tour (e.g., minimizing travel distance or time) introduces a new technical requirement that is not taught or suggested by D1.\n\n3. **Use of a cache memory storing previously determined optimal tours** \u2013 D1 contains no teaching about re\u2011using earlier computed routes. Accessing a cache to retrieve a pre\u2011computed optimal tour is a distinct technical feature that improves efficiency but is not disclosed or implied by D1.\n\nTo assess inventive step under the EPO approach, the skilled person would start from D1 and the identified problem (providing a convenient way for a user to purchase several selected items with minimal travel). The question is whether the skilled person, using common general knowledge, would have been motivated to modify D1 in the direction of the three differences in an obvious manner.\n\n* The move from a single\u2011product selection to multiple products is not a trivial extension. D1\u2019s teaching is centred on the nearest\u2011vendor concept; it provides no guidance on handling a set of products or on how to combine vendor locations.\n\n* The notion of an \"optimal shopping tour\" involves solving a routing optimisation problem (akin to the travelling\u2011salesman problem). While routing optimisation is known in the art, D1 does not address it, nor does it suggest that the server should compute such a route for a shopping purpose. Introducing this feature therefore requires a non\u2011obvious technical contribution.\n\n* The use of a cache to store previously computed tours adds another layer of technical effect (reduced computation time, faster response). D1 does not disclose any caching mechanism, and there is no indication that the skilled person would combine caching with the routing idea in the specific context of mobile shopping.\n\nBecause none of the three distinguishing features are disclosed, suggested, or rendered obvious by D1, and because their combination yields a technical solution that solves the problem of efficiently purchasing multiple items, the subject\u2011matter of claim\u202f1 involves an inventive step.\n\nHence, based strictly on the provided case data, claim\u202f1 would be considered to involve an inventive step over D1.", "answer": "Claim\u202f1 involves an inventive step over the closest prior art (D1)."}

USER: 
ASSISTANT: {"reasoning": "The closest prior art (D1) already discloses a system that stores, for each subscriber, an identifier and the maximum data rate of the DSL connection, and transmits video at that maximum rate. The claimed invention differs from D1 in two respects: (1) it stores an indication of an *available* data rate that is lower than the maximum data rate, and (2) it uses this available data rate to determine the transmission rate instead of always using the maximum rate.\n\nTo assess inventive step under the European Patent Convention (EPC), we apply the problem\u2011solution approach:\n\n1. **Determine the closest prior art** \u2013 D1 is correctly identified.\n2. **Establish the objective technical problem** \u2013 The problem can be formulated as \u201chow to avoid over\u2011loading the data connection when the actual usable bandwidth is lower than the maximum capacity stored in the database\u201d.\n3. **Identify the distinguishing features** \u2013 Storing an available (lower) data rate and using it to set the transmission rate.\n4. **Consider whether the skilled person would arrive at the solution in an obvious manner** \u2013 In the field of broadband video delivery, it is common knowledge that the maximum nominal DSL rate is not always achievable due to line conditions, congestion, or other temporary impairments. Adaptive bitrate streaming, congestion control, and dynamic rate adaptation are well\u2011known techniques in the art. A skilled person faced with the problem of preventing buffer underruns or excessive packet loss would naturally consider measuring or estimating the currently available bandwidth and adjusting the transmission rate accordingly. The modification of D1 to store a lower, currently available rate instead of the static maximum, and to use that value for rate selection, does not require any teaching beyond what is generally known in the networking community. No technical teaching or teaching away is present in D1 that would discourage such a modification.\n\nTherefore, the distinguishing features would have been obvious to the skilled person in view of D1 combined with the general knowledge of adaptive transmission in data networks.\n\n**Conclusion** \u2013 The subject\u2011matter of claim 1 lacks an inventive step (Article 56 EPC) over D1.", "answer": "The claim does not involve an inventive step; the differences over D1 would have been obvious to a skilled person."}

Step (ii): Document D1, which discloses a method for facilitating shopping on a mobile device wherein the user selects a single product and the server determines from a database the vendor selling the selected product nearest to the user and transmits this information to the mobile device, is selected as the closest prior art.

Step (iii): The differences between the subject-matter of claim 1 and D1 are:

(1)
The user can select two or more products to purchase (instead of a single product only). 

(2)
An "optimal shopping tour" for purchasing the two or more products is provided to the user. 

(3)
The optimal shopping tour is determined by the server by accessing a cache memory in which optimal shopping tours determined for previous requests are stored. 

--- PATENT CLAIMS ---
Claim 1:

Method of facilitating shopping on a mobile device wherein:

(a)
the user selects two or more products to be purchased;

(b)
the mobile device transmits the selected products data and the device location to a server;

USER: 
ASSISTANT: {"reasoning": "The closest prior art (D1) discloses a method in which a mobile\u2011device user selects a single product, the server determines the nearest vendor for that product and sends the vendor information to the device. The subject\u2011matter of claim\u202f1 differs from D1 in three respects:\n\n1. **Selection of two or more products** \u2013 D1 is limited to a single product. The claim expands the scope to a set of products, which changes the nature of the problem from locating a single vendor to planning a multi\u2011stop purchase.\n\n2. **Provision of an \"optimal shopping tour\"** \u2013 D1 only returns the nearest vendor for the selected product; it does not propose any route or sequence for acquiring multiple items. Determining an optimal tour (e.g., minimizing travel distance or time) introduces a new technical requirement that is not taught or suggested by D1.\n\n3. **Use of a cache memory storing previously determined optimal tours** \u2013 D1 contains no teaching about re\u2011using earlier computed routes. Accessing a cache to retrieve a pre\u2011computed optimal tour is a distinct technical feature that improves efficiency but is not disclosed or implied by D1.\n\nTo assess inventive step under the EPO approach, the skilled person would start from D1 and the identified problem (providing a convenient way for a user to purchase several selected items with minimal travel). The question is whether the skilled person, using common general knowledge, would have been motivated to modify D1 in the direction of the three differences in an obvious manner.\n\n* The move from a single\u2011product selection to multiple products is not a trivial extension. D1\u2019s teaching is centred on the nearest\u2011vendor concept; it provides no guidance on handling a set of products or on how to combine vendor locations.\n\n* The notion of an \"optimal shopping tour\" involves solving a routing optimisation problem (akin to the travelling\u2011salesman problem). While routing optimisation is known in the art, D1 does not address it, nor does it suggest that the server should compute such a route for a shopping purpose. Introducing this feature therefore requires a non\u2011obvious technical contribution.\n\n* The use of a cache to store previously computed tours adds another layer of technical effect (reduced computation time, faster response). D1 does not disclose any caching mechanism, and there is no indication that the skilled person would combine caching with the routing idea in the specific context of mobile shopping.\n\nBecause none of the three distinguishing features are disclosed, suggested, or rendered obvious by D1, and because their combination yields a technical solution that solves the problem of efficiently purchasing multiple items, the subject\u2011matter of claim\u202f1 involves an inventive step.\n\nHence, based strictly on the provided case data, claim\u202f1 would be considered to involve an inventive step over D1.", "answer": "Claim\u202f1 involves an inventive step over the closest prior art (D1)."}

USER: 
ASSISTANT: {"reasoning": "The closest prior art (D1) discloses a method in which a mobile\u2011device user selects a single product, the server determines the nearest vendor for that product and sends the vendor information to the device. The subject\u2011matter of claim\u202f1 differs from D1 in three respects:\n\n1. **Selection of two or more products** \u2013 D1 is limited to a single product. The claim expands the scope to a set of products, which changes the nature of the problem from locating a single vendor to planning a multi\u2011stop purchase.\n\n2. **Provision of an \"optimal shopping tour\"** \u2013 D1 only returns the nearest vendor for the selected product; it does not propose any route or sequence for acquiring multiple items. Determining an optimal tour (e.g., minimizing travel distance or time) introduces a new technical requirement that is not taught or suggested by D1.\n\n3. **Use of a cache memory storing previously determined optimal tours** \u2013 D1 contains no teaching about re\u2011using earlier computed routes. Accessing a cache to retrieve a pre\u2011computed optimal tour is a distinct technical feature that improves efficiency but is not disclosed or implied by D1.\n\nTo assess inventive step under the EPO approach, the skilled person would start from D1 and the identified problem (providing a convenient way for a user to purchase several selected items with minimal travel). The question is whether the skilled person, using common general knowledge, would have been motivated to modify D1 in the direction of the three differences in an obvious manner.\n\n* The move from a single\u2011product selection to multiple products is not a trivial extension. D1\u2019s teaching is centred on the nearest\u2011vendor concept; it provides no guidance on handling a set of products or on how to combine vendor locations.\n\n* The notion of an \"optimal shopping tour\" involves solving a routing optimisation problem (akin to the travelling\u2011salesman problem). While routing optimisation is known in the art, D1 does not address it, nor does it suggest that the server should compute such a route for a shopping purpose. Introducing this feature therefore requires a non\u2011obvious technical contribution.\n\n* The use of a cache to store previously computed tours adds another layer of technical effect (reduced computation time, faster response). D1 does not disclose any caching mechanism, and there is no indication that the skilled person would combine caching with the routing idea in the specific context of mobile shopping.\n\nBecause none of the three distinguishing features are disclosed, suggested, or rendered obvious by D1, and because their combination yields a technical solution that solves the problem of efficiently purchasing multiple items, the subject\u2011matter of claim\u202f1 involves an inventive step.\n\nHence, based strictly on the provided case data, claim\u202f1 would be considered to involve an inventive step over D1.", "answer": "Claim\u202f1 involves an inventive step over the closest prior art (D1)."}

--- CLOSEST PRIOR ART ---
Step (ii): Document D1, which discloses a method for facilitating shopping on a mobile device wherein the user selects a single product and the server determines from a database the vendor selling the selected product nearest to the user and transmits this information to the mobile device, is selected as the closest prior art.

Step (iii): The differences between the subject-matter of claim 1 and D1 are:

(1)
The user can select two or more products to purchase (instead of a single product only). 

(2)
An "optimal shopping tour" for purchasing the two or more products is provided to the user. 

(3)
The optimal shopping tour is determined by the server by accessing a cache memory in which optimal shopping tours determined for previous requests are stored. 

--- PATENT CLAIMS ---
Claim 1:

Method of facilitating shopping on a mobile device wherein:

(a)
the user selects two or more products to be purchased;

(b)
the mobile device transmits the selected products data and the device location to a server;

(c)
the server accesses a database of vendors to identify vendors offering at least one of the selected products;

(d)
the server determines, on the basis of the device location and the identified vendors, an optimal shopping tour for purchasing the selected products by accessing a cache memory in which optimal shopping tours determined for previous requests are stored; and

(e)
the server transmits the optimal shopping tour to the mobile device for displaying.

HISTORY:
USER: 
ASSISTANT: {"reasoning": "The closest prior art (D1) discloses a method in which a mobile\u2011device user selects a single product, the server determines the nearest vendor for that product and sends the vendor information to the device. The subject\u2011matter of claim\u202f1 differs from D1 in three respects:\n\n1. **Selection of two or more products** \u2013 D1 is limited to a single product. The claim expands the scope to a set of products, which changes the nature of the problem from locating a single vendor to planning a multi\u2011stop purchase.\n\n2. **Provision of an \"optimal shopping tour\"** \u2013 D1 only returns the nearest vendor for the selected product; it does not propose any route or sequence for acquiring multiple items. Determining an optimal tour (e.g., minimizing travel distance or time) introduces a new technical requirement that is not taught or suggested by D1.\n\n3. **Use of a cache memory storing previously determined optimal tours** \u2013 D1 contains no teaching about re\u2011using earlier computed routes. Accessing a cache to retrieve a pre\u2011computed optimal tour is a distinct technical feature that improves efficiency but is not disclosed or implied by D1.\n\nTo assess inventive step under the EPO approach, the skilled person would start from D1 and the identified problem (providing a convenient way for a user to purchase several selected items with minimal travel). The question is whether the skilled person, using common general knowledge, would have been motivated to modify D1 in the direction of the three differences in an obvious manner.\n\n* The move from a single\u2011product selection to multiple products is not a trivial extension. D1\u2019s teaching is centred on the nearest\u2011vendor concept; it provides no guidance on handling a set of products or on how to combine vendor locations.\n\n* The notion of an \"optimal shopping tour\" involves solving a routing optimisation problem (akin to the travelling\u2011salesman problem). While routing optimisation is known in the art, D1 does not address it, nor does it suggest that the server should compute such a route for a shopping purpose. Introducing this feature therefore requires a non\u2011obvious technical contribution.\n\n* The use of a cache to store previously computed tours adds another layer of technical effect (reduced computation time, faster response). D1 does not disclose any caching mechanism, and there is no indication that the skilled person would combine caching with the routing idea in the specific context of mobile shopping.\n\nBecause none of the three distinguishing features are disclosed, suggested, or rendered obvious by D1, and because their combination yields a technical solution that solves the problem of efficiently purchasing multiple items, the subject\u2011matter of claim\u202f1 involves an inventive step.\n\nHence, based strictly on the provided case data, claim\u202f1 would be considered to involve an inventive step over D1.", "answer": "Claim\u202f1 involves an inventive step over the closest prior art (D1)."}

The patent claim presented for assessment is word‑for‑word identical to that prior‑art claim, containing the same steps (a) through (f). Because there are no distinguishing features, the claimed subject‑matter is not novel and, consequently, cannot involve an inventive step. Under the European Patent Convention (EPC) the requirement of inventive step (Article 56 EPC) is not satisfied when the claimed invention is directly disclosed in the prior art. Therefore, a person skilled in the art would find the claimed method obvious in light of the disclosed prior art.",

CURRENT QUESTION: 
------------------------------------------------------------


[LLM RESPONSE]:
{
  "reasoning": "The closest prior art (D1) discloses a method in which a mobile‑device user selects a single product, the server determines the nearest vendor for that product and sends the vendor information to the device.  Claim 1 differs from D1 in three respects:\n\n1. **Selection of two or more products** – D1 is limited to a single product.  The skilled person would have to consider whether extending the method to multiple products is obvious.  While a user could in principle repeat the single‑product request for each desired item, D1 does not teach or suggest aggregating several selections into a single request or handling them jointly.\n\n2. **Provision of an \"optimal shopping tour\"** – D1 only provides the nearest vendor for a single product; it does not teach the concept of a tour that optimises the order of visiting multiple vendors to purchase several items.  The notion of a shopping tour involves route optimisation (e.g., travelling‑salesman‑type problem) which is not disclosed or hinted at in D1.\n\n3. **Use of a cache memory storing previously determined optimal tours** – D1 contains no teaching about caching or re‑using previously computed tours.  The skilled person would have to combine the idea of a cache (known in other contexts) with the specific problem of optimal shopping tours.  No suggestion or motivation is present in D1 to retrieve pre‑computed tours from a cache to reduce computation.\n\nTo assess inventive step under the problem‑solution approach, the objective technical problem can be formulated as “how to enable a mobile‑device user to obtain a convenient plan for purchasing several selected products from multiple vendors”.  The solution is the combination of the three features above.  None of the features is disclosed in D1, and the combination is not rendered obvious by the teaching of D1.  While route optimisation and caching are known in the art, D1 provides no teaching that would lead the skilled person to apply these known techniques to the specific problem of multi‑product shopping on a mobile device.  Consequently, the skilled person would not arrive at the claimed method in an obvious manner.\n\nTherefore, the subject‑matter of claim 1 involves an inventive step over D1.",
  "answer": "Yes, claim 1 is inventive over the closest prior art D1. The three distinguishing features – (i) selection of two or more products, (ii) provision of an optimal shopping tour, and (iii) use of a cache storing previously determined tours – are not disclosed or suggested by D1, and their combination would not have been obvious to a person skilled in the art. Consequently, the claimed method satisfies the requirement of inventive step under the EPO standards."

--- CLOSEST PRIOR ART ---
Step (ii): Document D1, which discloses a method for facilitating shopping on a mobile device wherein the user selects a single product and the server determines from a database the vendor selling the selected product nearest to the user and transmits this information to the mobile device, is selected as the closest prior art.

Step (iii): The differences between the subject-matter of claim 1 and D1 are:

(1)
The user can select two or more products to purchase (instead of a single product only). 

(2)
An "optimal shopping tour" for purchasing the two or more products is provided to the user. 

(3)
The optimal shopping tour is determined by the server by accessing a cache memory in which optimal shopping tours determined for previous requests are stored. 

--- PATENT CLAIMS ---
Claim 1:

Method of facilitating shopping on a mobile device wherein:

(a)
the user selects two or more products to be purchased;

(b)
the mobile device transmits the selected products data and the device location to a server;

(c)
the server accesses a database of vendors to identify vendors offering at least one of the selected products;

(d)
the server determines, on the basis of the device location and the identified vendors, an optimal shopping tour for purchasing the selected products by accessing a cache memory in which optimal shopping tours determined for previous requests are stored; and

(e)
the server transmits the optimal shopping tour to the mobile device for displaying.
