--- APPEAL FACTS ---
I. The applicant (appellant) filed an appeal against the decision of the Examining Division posted on 8 August 2008 refusing European patent application No. 03076109.2.

II. The decision made reference to the following documents:

D1: Wongvasu N. et al.: "Representing the relationship between items in logical bill-of-material to support customers' requests for quotation for make-to-order products", Proceedings of SPIE, Vol. 4192, p. 74-85 (2000); and

D3: Gu P. et al.: "Product modelling using STEP", Computer-Aided Design, Vol. 27, No. 3, p. 163-179, (March 1995).

The Examining Division decided that the main request contravened Article 123(2) EPC, that claim 1 of the first auxiliary request lacked an inventive step over a combination of documents D1 and D3, but also without reference to a document, and that the second auxiliary request again contravened Article 123(2) EPC.

III. With the statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant filed a copy of the post-published document

D4: Callahan S.: "Extended Generic Product Structure: An Information Model for Representing Product Families", Journal of Computing and Information Science in Engineering, Vol. 6, p. 263-275 (September 2006).

The appellant further indicated that a declaration by an expert in the field was expected to be filed soon. No such declaration has been submitted.

The appellant requested that the decision be set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of a main request or, in the alternative, on the basis of a first or a second auxiliary request. According to the statement of grounds of appeal, the main request corresponded to the first auxiliary request as filed in the first-instance proceedings and the first auxiliary request corresponded to the second auxiliary request as filed in the first-instance proceedings.

IV. The claims of the main request, the first auxiliary request ("auxiliary request I") and the second auxiliary request ("auxiliary request II") were filed on 22 December 2008 together with the "confirmation copy" of the statement of grounds of appeal, i.e. after expiry of the time limit for the statement of grounds of appeal. The claims of the main request corresponded to those of the first auxiliary request before the department of first instance. Claim 1 of auxiliary request I corresponded to claim 1 of the second auxiliary request before the department of first instance. The dependent claims of auxiliary request I differed from those of the second auxiliary request before the department of first instance.

V. The Board appointed oral proceedings. In a communication accompanying the summons to oral proceedings, the Board provisionally expressed a negative opinion on all requests. Among other objections, claim 1 of both the main request and auxiliary request I appeared to lack an inventive step. Questions were raised regarding the admissibility of auxiliary request II.

VI. With a letter dated 11 February 2014, the appellant informed the Board that it would not appear at the oral proceedings. The letter did not address any of the issues raised in the communication accompanying the summons.

VII. The oral proceedings were held on 10 March 2014 in the absence of the appellant. At the end of the oral proceedings the chairman announced the decision of the Board.

VIII. Claim 1 of the main request reads as follows:

"A method of designing products using CAD and of manufacturing products using CAM, wherein a product data-model is stored in a memory associated with a computer, said product data-model representing product information about at least one component that is a constituent of at least one parent assembly, comprising:

a parent assembly and two or more children, each comprising at least one component, said parent assembly holding information for associating the two children with the parent assembly;

a plurality of component-usages for holding information relating to usages of the component, said component-usages being operatively connected to a component of the parent assembly;

a plurality of logical component-usages for holding information relating to logical usages of the component, said logical component-usages being operatively connected to said component-usages; and

said parent assembly, said component-usages and said logical component-usages being hierarchically interconnected."

IX. Claim 1 of auxiliary request I reads as follows:

"A method of designing products using CAD and of manufacturing products using CAM, wherein a product data-model is stored in a memory associated with a computer, said product data-model representing product information about at least one component that is a constituent of at least one parent assembly, said data model comprising a parent assembly and two or more children, said parent assembly holding information for associating the two children with the parent assembly, said method comprising:

selecting one component-usage to be included in a product configuration from a plurality of component-usages in said data model and for holding information relating to usages of the component;

selecting one from the component-usages connected to it from a plurality of logical component-usages of said data model and for holding information relating to logical usages of the component, said logical component-usages being operatively connected to said component-usages; wherein said logical component-usages are used to identify the existence of a role for said component-usages in an assembly configuration represented by a general motional [sic] mechanism for expressing to which particular configuration each logical component-usage and component-usage is applicable, the logical component usages are labeled with applicability attributes (O1, O2) that determine whether they apply to a given product configuration, including option attributes (O1, O2) of which the options are mutually exclusive."

X. Claim 1 of auxiliary request II reads as follows:

"A method for representing assembly configurations using a generalized occurrence structure stored in a memory, comprising:

(a) constructing a plurality of occurrence nodes corresponding to paths in a representation of a product data-model comprising hierarchically interconnected parent assembly, a plurality of component-usages, and a plurality of logical component-usages;

(b) constructing a plurality of logical occurrence nodes associated with a plurality of said occurrence nodes;

(c) storing product data in said occurrence nodes;

(d) associating a plurality of part-interfaces with said occurrence nodes;

(e) associating a plurality of part usages with a plurality of logical occurrence nodes depending upon logical relationships between said part-usages; and

(f) forming a mapping of a plurality of computer-aided designs of said parts with said product data-model

wherein said step (a) further comprises

forming a mapping of at least one manufacturing assembly sequence to at least one computer-aided-design that is stored in said product data model, said manufacturing assembly sequence comprising a plurality of manufacturing assemblies which include a plurality of components and a plurality of assemblies, wherein it is ensured by an effectivity or applicability scheme that for any one valid assembly configuration of the parent assembly 12 using the logical component usage node 18, there is only one component usage node 14, the logical component usage node 18 determining which one of the multiple (if any) component usage nodes 14 associated with it becomes part of a given valid assembly configuration of the parent assembly 12."

XI. In support of inventive step, the appellant essentially argued as follows:

The data models described in the claims were used in the technical field of computer-aided design systems and computer-aided manufacturing environments. In this technical field virtual product modelling could expedite a design process for a family of products sharing an overall product architecture. The designer could customise the product selected from a product family that included many product variants.

Before the present invention, a designer reconstructed relationships between product design domains, either mentally or with some minimal computer support. Manual tracking of such relationships incurred high costs and was prone to errors. Reduced use of effectivity, viz. defining which part went into each end product configuration, meant diminishing knowledge of what was common among different product designs.

The invention avoided the undesirable situation where there were many copies of engineering bill-of-material assembly definitions that were similar but had unique copies of product structure definitions. In addition, multiple and independent drawings, CAD data and product structures for variance were eliminated.

The "logical component usage" concept was used to check the consistency of the selection of component usages and was a mechanism to help designers understand which component usages were alternative to each other, versus which component usages fulfilled different purposes in the design.

The present invention introduced logical component usage as an abstraction of component usage. In the prior art a component usage was considered to be a relationship object. It was counter-intuitive to consider abstracting a relationship.

The invention introduced the idea of considering a component usage as a lightweight copy of a component instead of as a relationship. This allowed component usage to be abstracted, since it had become a virtual thing instead of a relationship. This concept of a lightweight copy was further introduced in document D4.

TITLE: Representing the relationship between items in logical
bill-of-material to support customers’ request for quotation for
make-to-order products

TYPE: Academic Paper

ABSTRACT: 

For make-to-order products in which the specification of some component-product variants are to be defined by
customers, it is almost impossible to develop a bill-of-material system that support customers’ requests for quotation
(RFQ) response activities usingthe existingbill-of-material concepts. To deal with this problem, a new technique
for representingthe relationship between parent-product variants and component-product variants in the generic
bill-of-material (GBOM) structure is developed. The new technique is based on an assumption that the relationship
between any two components in a product structure has pairwise independent property. The technique represents the
relationship with compatibility constraints in the form of matrices and rules. The new representation provides users
with a means to describingvariants of make-to-order products as well as supportingthe customers’ RFQ response
activities with only a limited amount of data which is comprehensive, easy to maintain, and easy to understand.

--- APPEAL FACTS ---
I. This appeal ("second appeal") is against the decision of the examining division ("second decision"), posted on 30 November 2010, to refuse European patent application No. 02028629.0 on the grounds that the prior art was not properly acknowledged (Rule 27(1)(b) EPC 1973), that the two-part form was not properly provided (Rule 29(1)(a)(b) EPC 1973), and that the subject-matter of the application lacked an inventive step (Article 56 EPC) with respect to a main request, a first auxiliary request, and a second auxiliary request, having regard to the disclosure of

D2: "Enhanced Symbol Mapping method for the

modulation of Turbo-coded bits based on bit

priority", 3GPP TSG RAN WG1/WG2 Joint Meeting

D2: "Enhanced Symbol Mapping method for the,

and the skilled person's common general knowledge as evidenced by

D7: "TS 25.212 V1.0.0", 3GPP TSG RAN WG1,

Multiplexing and channel coding (FDD), pp. 1-38,

April 1999.

A previous appeal ("first appeal") against the former decision of the examining division ("first decision"), posted on 16 February 2009, to refuse the present patent application on the grounds that the prior art was not properly acknowledged (Rule 42(1)(b) EPC), that the two-part form was not properly provided (Rule 43(1) EPC), and that the claims lacked clarity (Article 84 EPC) with respect to a sole request was settled by a decision, taken by this board in an entirely different composition ("the former board"), ordering that the first decision be set aside, that the case be remitted to the examining division for further prosecution, and that the appeal fee be reimbursed following a substantial procedural violation committed by the examining division (cf. T 1123/09). As to the reasoning of that decision, the former board held inter alia that the appellant had the right to amend the description to acknowledge the respective prior-art documents following the objection raised by the examining division under Rule 27(1)(b) EPC 1973 (cf. point 3), that the formulation of the pending independent claims in the two-part form had to be postponed (cf. point 4), that the objected claims were clear (cf. point 6), and that the examining division had committed a substantial procedural violation in using new and unsupported principles with regard to the application of

Rule 27(1)(b) EPC 1973 (Rule 42(1)(b) EPC) in that case (cf. point 8).

II. Notice of appeal was received on 10 February 2011. The appeal fee was paid on the same day. With the statement setting out the grounds of appeal, received on 8 April 2011, the appellant filed new claims according to a main request, a first auxiliary request, and a second auxiliary request. It requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of the main request or any of the auxiliary requests. In addition, oral proceedings were requested as an auxiliary measure.

III. A summons to oral proceedings scheduled for 1 October 2013 was issued on 11 July 2013. In an annex to this summons, the board expressed its preliminary opinion on the appeal pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA. In particular, objections were raised by the board under Articles 123(2) and 56 EPC, in view of D2 and D7.

IV. With a letter of reply dated 30 August 2013, the appellant filed amended claims according to a main request and an auxiliary request. It also submitted arguments as to why D7 did not disclose the established distinguishing features and advised that a "more detailed explanation" would be provided during the oral proceedings.

V. Oral proceedings were held as scheduled on 1 October 2013, during which the former main and auxiliary requests were replaced by a new main request (claims 1 to 8) as a sole request in response to objections raised by the board under Articles 123(2) and 56 EPC. The main request was admitted into the appeal proceedings and its patentability was discussed.

The appellant's final request was that the decision under appeal be set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of the main request as filed during the oral proceedings before the board. At the end of the oral proceedings, the board announced its decision.

VI. Claim 1 of the main request reads as follows:

"An apparatus for data transmission in a communication system, comprising:

a turbo encoder (220) for turbo coding data bits to generate systematic bits and parity bits;

a rate matcher (230) for rate matching the systematic bits and parity bits;

a first and second interleaver (250, 260) for separately writing the rate-matched systematic bits and the rate-matched parity bits; and

a modulator (280) for alternately mapping bits collected from the first interleaver and the second interleaver onto one modulation symbol according to a modulation scheme,

characterized in that

the first interleaver is arranged for writing the rate-matched systematic bits row by row from a first row to a last row, and the second interleaver is arranged for writing the rate-matched parity bits row by row from a first row to a last row, wherein the first and second interleavers are arranged for then separately interleaving the systematic bits and the parity bits by performing inter-column permutation, respectively, according to a determined rule,

wherein the modulator is arranged for alternately collecting the permutated bits column by column in the first interleaver and the second interleaver, and

wherein in case that a number of the rate-matched systematic bits is too large for them to be written into the first interleaver, the excessive number of rate-matched systematic bits is written in the second interleaver."

The further independent claim 4 of the main request is directed to a corresponding method, while independent claims 7 and 8 are directed to a complementary apparatus and method, respectively.

TITLE: Adaptive HARQ for fixed TTI using soft acknowledgement

TYPE: Working Group Document

DOCUMENT:

We showed a physical layer structure and coding scheme that combines the advantages of the conventional fixed 
and variable TTI proposals by allowing to use two parallel data streams for each TTI. The main benefits are: 
• flexible mapping of required retransmission energy using MCS level and code rate adaptation, as 
well as bit mapping, 
• reduced interference, 
• allows soft-combining of retransmissions at different MCS levels,
• high frame fill efficiency, 
• increased throughput, 
• maintains simplicity of fixed TTI. 
The concepts presented in this paper are suitable for incremental redundancy, but can also be adapted to Chase 
combining.

--- APPEAL FACTS ---
I. The appeal is against the decision of the examining division, posted on 11 February 2011, to refuse European patent application No. 09159981.1 on the ground of lack of inventive step (Article 56 EPC) with respect to the independent claims of a main request and an auxiliary request, having regard to the disclosure of

D1: Y.C. Lai et al.: "Design and implementation of

a wireless internet remote access platform",

Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,

Vol. 6, pp. 413-429, 9 January 2006.

II. Notice of appeal was received on 7 April 2011. The appeal fee was paid on the same day. With the statement setting out the grounds of appeal, received on 11 May 2011, the appellant re-filed the claims of the main and the auxiliary requests underlying the appealed decision. It requested that the decision of the examining division be set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of the main request or the auxiliary request.

III. A summons to oral proceedings scheduled for 7 August 2014 was issued on 12 May 2014. In an annex to this summons, the board gave its preliminary opinion on the appeal pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA. In particular, objections were raised under Article 56 EPC in view of D1 and the skilled person's common general knowledge.

IV. With a letter of reply dated 7 July 2014, the appellant submitted amended claims according to a new main request and a first auxiliary request. It also re-filed the claims of the previous auxiliary request as a second auxiliary request and provided counter-arguments with regard to the objections raised in the board's communication under Article 15(1) RPBA.

V. Following a request of the appellant, a telephone conversation was held between the appellant's representative and the rapporteur of this case during which the representative was informed that, according to the preliminary opinion of the board, the objections under Article 56 EPC were maintained.

VI. By letter of reply dated 5 August 2014, the appellant informed the board that it would not be attending the scheduled oral proceedings and requested that the appeal be allowed based on the pending requests filed on 7 July 2014. It also submitted that the claims of those requests had been "further distinguished over D1 to provide an inventive step" and had "placed the application in a condition ready for grant".

VII. Oral proceedings were held as scheduled on 7 August 2014 in the absence of the appellant. The board established from the file that the appellant's final request was that the decision under appeal be set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of one of the main request, the first auxiliary request and the second auxiliary request, all requests as filed with letter dated 7 July 2014.

After due deliberation on the basis of the pending requests and the written submissions, the board announced its decision at the end of the oral proceedings.

VIII. Claim 1 of the main request reads as follows:

"A method in a wireless hand-held device of composing an e-mail message that will include a remote file attachment, comprising:

receiving a user instruction to attach a file (410) to an e-mail message for at least one recipient;

in response to receiving the user instruction, requesting a file browsing service on a file delivery server via a network to obtain a list of files in a directory;

if file access credentials (418) are required to access the directory:

prompting for file access credentials (418)

needed to access the directory;

furnishing the file access credentials (428) to the file browsing service;

presenting the list of files using a user interface of the wireless hand-held device (422,424);

receiving another user instruction to send the e-mail message (428), along with a file from the list of files to attach to the e-mail message (426); and

sending, to a mail agent, a portion of the

e-mail message and an attachment instruction identifying the file and the file access credentials (430), wherein the attachment instruction causes the mail agent to assemble a complete e-mail message comprising at least the portion of the e-mail message and the file identified in the attachment instruction retrieved using the file access credentials (430) and the file delivery server (436)."

TITLE: Design and implementation of a wireless internet remote access platform

TYPE: Academic Paper

ABSTRACT:

Recently, mobile networks and internet technologies have been widely developed for the voice communication and information retrieval services all over the world. Compared with the wire-line internet environment, mobile networks have lower bandwidth, longer transmission latency and unreliable connection, and the capability of mobile terminals is restricted by the limited memory size, lower CPU computation capability and inconvenient I/O interface. These limitations restrict the development of the wireless internet applications. In this paper, we design and implement a ‘wireless internet remote access platform’ (WIRAP). The WIRAP platform interconnects the wireless network and internet to provide mobile users a remote centralized storage and computation environment. A mobile user can store large volume of data and execute complex computations on WIRAP instead of on the mobile terminals. WIRAP supports different network interfaces (e.g. short message service (SMS), wireless markup language (WML) and hyper text markup language (HTML) and users may use terminals (with different network capabilities) to access WIRAP.

--- APPEAL FACTS ---
I. The appeal lies from the decision of the Examining Division refusing European patent application No. 08 873 572.5.

II. Inter alia the following documents were cited in the examination proceedings:

(2) EP-A-82621,

(7) US-A-2004/220615,

(17) WO 2008/013763 and

(19) http://www.orthosupersite.com/images/content/OT/200505/DBM.pdf (pdf dated May 2005).

III. In the decision under appeal, the Examining Division found that that the subject-matter of the then pending main request did not fulfil the requirements of Articles 123(2) and 56 EPC. More particularly, it found that claim 1 of said request found a basis in the application as filed, but not the late-filed drawings. With regard to inventive step, a demineralised bone matrix (DBM) of document (19) represented the closest prior art, the subject-matter of said claim not being inventive thereover in the light of documents (2), (7) and/or (17), which taught porous mesh coverings for bone implants.

IV. With letter dated 23 January 2017, the Appellant (Applicant) submitted a main request and auxiliary requests 1 to 3 and 4a to 4d and withdrew the request made before the Examining Division to insert figures 13a to 13g into the specification. During oral proceedings before the Board, held on 23 February 2017, it filed a new main request, replacing the previous main request.

V. The Appellant submitted that the subject-matter of all requests complied with the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC. By withdrawing the request to insert figures 13a to 13g into the specification, the objections in point 12 of the contested decision under Article 123(2) EPC were overcome. With regard to inventive step, the product Grafton® DBM Crunch of document (19) represented the closest prior art. The declaration of Dr. D. Shimko filed with letter dated 23 January 2017 containing further experimental data comparing a delivery system according to the invention, namely Magnifuse® DBM, with said product, showed a performance improvement for Magnifuse® DBM over Grafton® DBM Crunch. Said improvement was unexpected, since at the date of filing of the present application it would have been counter-intuitive and gone against accepted teachings in this field for the skilled person seeking to promote bone fusion at a grafting site, to provide the bone products with a mesh covering which would act as a barrier between the bone products and the bone, inter alia document (23) being cited in this respect:

(23) D. G. Marchesi: "Spinal fusions: bone and bone substitutes", Eur. Spine J., 2000, 9, pages 372 to 378.

The skilled person would not have turned to the teachings of documents (2), (7) and/or (17) when seeking to develop an improved bone void filler product to maximise bone tissue regeneration. The claimed subject-matter was thus inventive.

VI. The Appellant requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of the main request as filed during oral proceedings before the Board, or, subsidiarily, on the basis of any of the auxiliary requests 1 to 3 and 4a to 4d as filed with letter dated 23 January 2017.

VII. At the end of the oral proceedings, the decision of the Board was announced.

--- APPEAL FACTS ---
I. This is an appeal against the refusal of European patent application No. 07 841 130 for lack of inventive step (Article 56 EPC 1973).

II. The applicant requested in writing that the decision under appeal be set aside and a patent be granted on the basis of claims 1 to 11 filed with letter dated 27 October 2009, as sole request.

Oral proceedings were also requested.

III. Claim 1 of this request reads as follows:

"1. A method for implementing a second-chance game to or an end of game drawing for players of a lottery game, comprising the steps of:

providing tickets for the lottery game, wherein the tickets are each assigned a unique validation code;

applying an algorithm to generate a unique, first encryption code for each ticket validation code;

storing the first encryption code in a record at a lottery provider;

distributing the tickets for possession by players of the lottery game;

allowing players to submit the unique validation codes for registration into a lottery provider's database;

on the part of the lottery provider, applying the algorithm to the submitted validation codes to create a second encryption code for each submitted validation code;

on the part of the lottery provider, comparing the second encryption code with the record of first encryption codes to determine whether a match exists; and

on the part of the lottery provider, registering players for the second-chance game or for the end of game drawing when such players submit a validation code that results in a match."

Claims 2 to 11 are dependent on claim 1.

IV. The following documents are mentioned in this decision:

D1 = US 2005/0262338 A

D2 = US 2006/0059363 A

D4 = "The UNIX Programming Environment", Prentice-Hall Inc., 1984, pp. 52-53

V. The examining division essentially argued that:

- Document D1 disclosed a lottery game in which tickets with a unique validation code were provided and distributed to the players of the lottery game. The problem to be solved by the application could be formulated as providing an alternative cryptographic access and authentication scheme to the scheme suggested in D1. Document D2 disclosed the generation and storage of hashes which were compared to hashed submitted information. The skilled person starting from D1 would incorporate the cryptographic access and authentication scheme of D2 in an obvious manner into D1 for the purpose of solving the problem. The remaining features of the method of claim 1 were rules and schemes of playing games and did not contribute in the assessment of inventive step.

VI. The appellant argued in writing essentially as follows:

- The present invention provided a secure validation and authentication system, wherein the players could enter instant lottery tickets, such as scratch-off tickets, into a subsequent game. According to one exemplary form of the present invention, lottery tickets were printed with a unique validation code. Once the validation codes were generated, the numbers were converted into encrypted validation codes. Along with a record of the encrypted validation codes, the tickets were transferred to a lottery provider who stored the record of the encrypted validation codes. Finally, the lottery provider distributed the lottery tickets. By encrypting the unique validation codes, it could be assured that there would be no record of these unique validation codes being accessible to unauthorized persons. Only the encrypted validation codes (first encryption codes) were transferred to the lottery provider. Thus a secure and easily manageable system for conducting a second-chance game or an end of game drawing based on instant-win lottery tickets was provided, since only the validation code from a ticket in the first game had to be entered to participate in the second-chance game. The system generated a second encryption code from the entered validation code and compared it to the first encryption code that was generated for that particular validation code. If the first and second encryption codes matched, then the player was automatically entered into the second-chance game or end of game drawing, and was eligible for winning the game without having to actually present the lottery ticket for redemption.

- Document D1 was considered by the examining division to be the closest prior art. This document disclosed a rather complicated method for authenticating a ticket across a network, including a plurality of document-printing terminals. Document D2 related to a completely different field than the present invention and D1. D2 centered on the correct delivery of a computerized device to a specific end user. Thus, there was no reason why a skilled person would look into D2 to solve the problem of the invention. The flow of information from a lottery provider to ticket terminals and back to the lottery provider (as in D1), as well as the flow of information from the distributor of computerized devices to an end user (as in D2) were not compatible and a combination was certainly not obvious to the skilled person.

VII. In a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA annexed to the summons to oral proceedings, the board informed the appellant of its provisional opinion that it shared his view that the combination of documents D1 and D2 did not lead to the invention, but that it nevertheless considered the invention to lack an inventive step having regard to a notorious lottery game and the disclosure of D4.

VIII. In reply to the objections raised by the board the appellant argued essentially that:

- Document D4 disclosed a broad teaching of the well-known UNIX system to store an encrypted record of passwords and, upon receipt of a password from a user, encrypting the received password and comparing such encryption to the record of stored encrypted passwords to determine validity of the received password. However, security of the validation record in the lottery industry was paramount and the flow of the validation numbers and validation records between the three involved entities: the lottery ticket manufacturer, the lottery provider, and the lottery player, were critical. The interplay between these entities was a relevant feature of the invention which had no relation to the UNIX system. Likewise, the relationship between the primary lottery game and the second-chance game or end of game drawing with respect to security had to be taken into account.

- With the current method, the ticket manufacturer generated the initial validation codes and printed such codes on the tickets in plain text format. These validation codes were the means for authenticating tickets in the primary lottery game. A fraudster gaining access to the validation codes at the ticket manufacturer could potentially determine wherein and whereto winning tickets were distributed, and the particular plain-text code printed on the winning tickets. The ticket manufacturer thus had a strong interest for developing a second chance game that was both user-friendly and secure.

- Even if a fraudster at the game provider with access to the game provider's server were somehow able to access individual tickets, the record of encrypted validation codes was essentially worthless to such fraudster in attempting to discern whether or not a ticket was a winning ticket. The record of encrypted validation codes was never linked back to a record of actual validation codes at the lottery ticket manufacturer. Thus, a fraudster having stolen a pack of tickets and having access to the record of encrypted validation codes could not use this information for trying to find out which of these tickets was a winning one. For this, he also would need to have access to the encryption algorithm. But even if the fraudster at the game provider were to gain access to the encryption algorithm, he would only be able to generate an encrypted validation code, and possibly compare this encrypted code to the record transmitted to the game provider. However, this would provide no useful information to the fraudster.

- If one would draw parallels, such a fraudulent determination of important information would correspond to getting access to the record of encrypted passwords on the UNIX server side as well as to stealing the corresponding user passwords and/or even the encryption algorithm. Such a scenario would be fatal for the use of the UNIX system. More specifically, in the case of a UNIX system, if a fraudster got to know the password of the user, he could use this password for entering the UNIX files of said user. A fraudster would not even need to have access to the record of encrypted validation codes and/or the encryption algorithm. Stealing a user password and gaining access to the UNIX system therefore led to a completely different scenario. Thus, a skilled person would not resort to the method described in D4 when wanting to offer security to the provider and comfort to the player for a second chance game.

- The flow of encrypted and plain-text validation codes between the parties served for purposes of the second chance game while ensuring security in the primary game. Thus, the method according to the invention kept up with the existing security standard for a primary game while at the same time using the already existing information, i.e. the individual validation code on the ticket, to provide for a unique method of enabling a secondary game. Accordingly, the ticket itself did not need to be altered compared to a ticket offering only one game. Only a record of encryption codes had to be established at the lottery provider as well as an algorithm, which calculated an encryption code based on the validation code transmitted by the player to the provider for the purpose of comparing the respective encrypted codes. The skilled person - even when being aware of the UNIX system according to D4 - would not come up with such a solution, which encompassed two different games having each their own security system, which however were linked via the same validation code on the ticket.

IX. The oral proceedings were held on 5 November 2015. Neither the appellant nor his representatives were present on the date of the oral proceedings. In a telephone conversation held by the board's registrar the representative's secretary informed her that the representative that had signed the last submissions in appeal was on holiday and the representative that had filed the appeal was not yet in his office. Thus the oral proceedings were held in the absence of the appellant.

--- APPEAL FACTS ---
I. The applicant appealed against the decision of the Examining Division, dispatched on 13 May 2014, to refuse the European patent application No. 04769910.3. The statement setting out the grounds of appeal was received on 16 September 2014.

II. The Examining Division refused the second and third auxiliary requests which were remitted to it following a decision by the present Board of Appeal in a different composition in case T 1983/09.

III. In case T 1983/09 the Board considered that the amendments made at the appeal stage had substantially changed the factual framework of the contested decision, and that an additional search could have been required to determine the relevant prior art (see penultimate paragraph of item 5.1 of that decision).

IV. In the decision under appeal in the present case the Examining Division held that the application did not meet the requirements of Article 56 EPC, having regard to document US 6 400 101 B1 (D5) in combination with the common general knowledge of a skilled person.

V. The appellant requested in writing that the decision under appeal be set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of a set of claims filed with the statement of grounds of appeal and corresponding to the claims of the former second auxiliary request.

VI. Claim 1 according to the appellant's sole request reads as follows.

"A system (20) for supplying power to an LED load (10), the system (20) comprising:

a LED driver module (30) operable to regulate a flow of a LED current (ILED) through the LED load (10) as a function of a temperature-dependent feedback signal (TDFS); and

a current controller module (60) in electric communication with said LED driver module (30) to communicate the temperature-dependent feedback signal (TDFS) to said LED driver module (10),

wherein said current controller module (60) is operable to generate the temperature-dependent feedback signal (TDFB) as a function of an operating temperature of the LED load (10) and the flow of the LED current (ILED) through the LED load (10), and

wherein said current controller module (600) includes:

means for generating a temperature feedback signal (VTF) as a function of a sensed operating temperature of the LED load (10);

wherein the temperature feedback signal is a temperature feedback voltage (VTF) and said current controller module (600) includes: a first operational amplifier (U1) operable to generate the temperature feedback voltage (VTF) as a function of the operating temperature of the LED load (10);

means for generating a current feedback signal (VCF) as a function of a sensed flow of the LED current (ILED) through the LED load (10);

wherein the current feedback signal is a current feedback voltage (VCF) and said current controller module (60) includes: a second operational amplifier (U2) operable to generate the current feedback voltage (VCF) as a function of the flow of the LED current (ILED) through the LED load (10); and

means for mixing the temperature feedback signal (VTF) and the current feedback signal (VCF) to yield the temperature and current-dependent feedback signal (TDFB),

wherein the temperature and current-dependent feedback signal (TDFB) is a feedback voltage generated as a mixture of the temperature feedback voltage (VTF) and the current feedback voltage (VCF)."

Claims 2 to 14 are dependent on claim 1.

VII. The appellant's arguments as far as they are relevant for the present decision can be summarised as follows:

The request in this appeal corresponded to the second auxiliary request addressed in the decision under appeal.

Claim 1 involved an inventive step over the disclosure of D5, D6 (US2002/130786 A1) and the alleged, but unproven "knowledge of the skilled person".

In D5, there was no disclosure of the following features which were required by claim 1 :

(i) a means for generating a temperature feedback signal which is a temperature feedback voltage (VTF) generated by a first operational amplifier (U1),

(ii) a means for generating a current feedback signal which is a current feedback voltage (VCF) generated by a second operational amplifier (U2), and

(iii) a means for mixing those signals to yield a temperature and current-dependent feedback signal (TDFB) which is a feedback voltage generated as a mixture of the temperature feedback voltage (VTF) and the current feedback voltage (VCF).

In the decision in case T 1983/09 the Board of Appeal held that D5 did not objectively disclose features (i) and (ii) identified above. The Board also stated that "D5 is indeed silent about the type of signal generated by the temperature regulation means and about the adder connected to the inverting input of the regulation means". Thus, according to the Board, D5 did not objectively disclose a temperature feedback voltage, so that feature (iii), which mentioned such a "temperature feedback voltage", was not disclosed either.

In paragraph 3.1.2 of the contested decision the Examining Division agreed that features (i) and (ii) were not disclosed in D5, but concluded, as stated in paragraph 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 of the decision that feature (iii) was disclosed in D5. This conclusion was not correct and contrary to the findings of fact stated by the Board of Appeal in the Reasons for the Decision in the case T 1983/09.

By providing these features in combination with the remaining features recited in claim 1, the claimed system provided a simple current controller module which provided a continuous feedback control of the LED as a function of both the sensed operating temperature of the LED load and the LED current through the LED load. In particular, it provided continuous control (page 11 , line 31 to page 12, line 6 of the original specification) over a wide temperature range. The two operational amplifiers operated independently to generate the respective voltage signals, which were then mixed. The use of the two operational amplifiers provided substantially aligned current and temperature control, and enabled the system to respond rapidly to current and temperature fluctuations.

As shown in Figure 3 of the present specification, the LED load was continuously controlled over a wide temperature range, based on the selection of a respective operational relationship between the resistive value of the LED load operating temperature sensor and the current through the LED load.

This technical effect of continuous control of current supplied to a LED driver with respect to temperature over an operating temperature range, in particular over a wide temperature range, had application, for example, in LED luminaires providing high quality light of a desired tuned colour temperature.

The objective technical problem starting from D5 was to provide a more simplified responsive feedback control of the power supply to the LED load so as to provide a temperature dependent control of the current supplied to the LED which could be continuous control of current supplied dependent on temperature over the operating temperature range.

The purpose of the circuitry of D5 on the other hand was primarily to prevent the LED from destruction resulting from an increased ambient temperature. Figure 3 of D5 showed the relationship between the forward current of the LED and ambient temperature. The current was constant up to an ambient temperature of 70°C and then was linearly reduced up to a maximum ambient temperature of 100°C, at which temperature the forward current of the LED was switched off. There was no disclosure or hint in D5 to solve the problem of providing a temperature dependent control of the current supplied to the LED as a continuous control of current supplied dependent on temperature over the operating temperature range.

Referring to paragraph 3.1.4 of the contested decision, even though operational amplifiers might have been known generally, there was no hint to the skilled person in D5 or D6, or in the common general knowledge, to somehow introduce two respective operational amplifiers into the circuit of Figure 8 of D5 in the specific manner recited in claim 1 and to process the specific respective signals recited in claim 1 in order to solve the correctly formulated objective technical problem. Moreover, no evidence of the common general knowledge had been provided.

The examining division relied upon D6 to assert that the skilled person, starting from D5, would "always consider the use of operational amplifiers for processing the measured signals". This unsubstantiated assertion indicated that the Examining Division had wrongly used hindsight in their analysis of inventive step.

TITLE: UNKNOWN

TYPE: US patent

DOCUMENT DESCRIPTION:

In accordance with the analysis of the content of D5 in case T 1983/09 the Board considers that document D5 discloses a system for supplying power to an LED load (cf. column 5, line 51 and figure 8) e.g. traffic lights (cf. column 4, lines 33 and 34), the system comprising:

a LED driver module (comparator and transistor T) operable to regulate a flow of a LED current ILED through the LED load as a function of a temperature-dependent feedback signal UREG (cf. figure 8 and column 7, lines 13 to 27); and

a current controller module (Regulator) in electric communication with said LED driver module to communicate the temperature-dependent feedback signal UREG to said LED driver module.

The current controller module is operable to generate a temperature-dependent feedback signal UREG in response to an operating temperature (signal input to the adder connected to the inverting input of the regulator) and the flow of the LED current through the LED load (signal at the non-inverting input of the regulator). The current controller module includes means for generating a temperature feedback signal as a function of a sensed operating temperature of the LED load (see column 4, lines 18 to 21 and column 7, lines 13 to 16 and figure 8: NTC and temperature regulation module) and means for generating a current feedback signal as a function of a sensed flow of the LED current ILED through the LED load (cf. column 2, lines 57 to 62). The current feedback signal is a current feedback voltage (output of the integrator is necessarily a voltage since it is applied to an input of an operational amplifier used as a regulator).

The system further comprises means for mixing the temperature feedback signal and the current feedback voltage (see figure 8: adder at the input of the regulator and the regulator drawn as an operational amplifier) to yield a temperature and current-dependent feedback voltage UREG.

--- APPEAL FACTS ---
I. The appeal is against the decision of the examining division to refuse the patent application in suit.

II. The examining division decided, inter alia, that the main request lacked clarity (Article 84 EPC) and an inventive step (Article 56 EPC) with regard to the following document:

D1: US 5 778 418.

III. With its statement setting out the grounds of appeal, the appellant filed claims 1 to 13 of an amended main request. The appellant requested that the decision be set aside and a patent be granted based on its amended main request. It requested oral proceedings as an auxiliary measure.

IV. In its preliminary opinion annexed to the summons to oral proceedings, the board raised objections under Article 84 EPC and Article 56 EPC with regard to D1 or, alternatively, the following document, cited in the search report:

D3: US 2005/172074

V. In its reply, the appellant re-filed its last main request and filed claims 1 to 3 of two auxiliary requests. At the oral proceedings held before the board, the appellant replaced these auxiliary requests with claim 1 of a new first auxiliary request.

TITLE: An architecture for ink annotations on Web documents

TYPE: Academic Paper

ABSTRACT:

There have been recent improvements in document technologies like the standardization of object interfaces to access and manipulate the properties of Web documents. There has also been significant progress in pen based computing for recognition of digital ink in desktops, tablets and handheld devices. These have necessitated a need for further research on annotation architectures for digital documents, specifically pen-based annotation systems. This paper presents an attempt to leverage the new standards of DHTML and W3C DOM that are being gradually implemented by popular browsers, to build a prototype of an ink annotation system with common components across browsers. One of the primary goals in this study is to semantically link ink data with underlying document elements like text and images. The system has three components: a) ink capture and rendering b) Ink Understanding, which recognizes and associates ink with the underlying document; and c) Ink storage and retrieval.

--- APPEAL FACTS ---
I. The appeal of the applicant (appellant) lies from the decision of the examining division announced at oral proceedings on 6 May 2011 to refuse European patent application n° 01 922 258.7.

II. The documents cited during the examination proceedings included the following:

D1: US-A-5,418,222

D2: EP-A-0 485 210

D5: J. Cappello et al., J. Controlled Release, 53 (1998), pages 105-117

III. The decision was based on two sets of claims filed with letter of 6 April 2011 as main request, and during oral proceedings on 6 May 2011 as auxiliary request.

Independent claim 1 of the main request related to a solvated compressed protein matrix material.

Independent claim 2 of the main request read as follows:

"2. A method of making a solvated compressed protein matrix material, comprising the steps of:

(a) preparing a coatable composition comprising one or more biocompatible protein materials and one or more biocompatible solvents;

(b) coating the composition to form a film;

(c) partially drying the coated film to a solvent content of 20% to 80% until the coated film can be formed into a non-brittle cohesive body;

(d) forming said cohesive body; and

(e) compressing the cohesive body to reduce bulk solvent and form a protein matrix material."

Independent claim 1 of the first auxiliary request read as follows:

"1. A method of making a solvated compressed protein matrix material, comprising the steps of:

(a) preparing a coatable composition comprising one or more biocompatible protein materials and one or more biocompatible solvents;

(b) coating the composition to form a film;

(c) partially drying the coated film to a solvent content of 35% to 80% until the coated film can be formed into a non-brittle cohesive body;

(d) forming said cohesive body; and

(e) compressing the cohesive body at a pressure of 689kPa to 689,500kPa (100psi to 100,000psi) for a time period of from 2 seconds to 48 hours to reduce bulk solvent and form a protein matrix material, having a solvent content of 30% to 50%."

IV. In its decision the examining division held inter alia that both D1 and D5 were prejudicial to the novelty of claim 1 of the main request.

The claims of the first auxiliary request met the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC. Novelty was established over D1 by virtue of the limitation of the solvent content of the product to the range of from 30 to 50%, and in that the pressure applied according to D1 is not further specified.

Claim 1 of the first auxiliary request did not meet the requirements of Article 56 EPC. D1 was the closest prior art since it related to collagen films for improving the sustained release delivery of a pharmaceutical, particularly in the context of enhancing wound healing. There was no evidence on file showing that the matrix material according to claim 1 was superior to that of D1 as alleged in terms of its strength, delayed degradation, and controlled delivery of an active agent. The pressure and time ranges recited were so broad that it was unlikely that an improvement could arise therefrom, and the claimed lower limit of 30% for the final solvent content of the material was within the range of the general teaching of D1 to provide from 10-30% glycerol. The objective technical problem was thus the provision of an alternative process for producing a solvated compressed protein matrix material. Such a process was conventional for the skilled person starting from the teaching of D1.

V. With the statement setting out the grounds of appeal dated 7 November 2011, the appellant submitted six sets of claims consisting of a main request and auxiliary requests 1-3, 5 and 6. A fourth claim set was not submitted, although the statement of grounds mentioned how such a request would be constructed.

Independent claim 2 was identical in the main request and the first to fourth auxiliary requests, and corresponded to independent claim 1 of the fifth auxiliary request. This claim was identical to claim 2 of the main request refused by the examining division (see point III above).

Independent claim 1 of the sixth auxiliary request corresponded to claim 1 of the first auxiliary request refused by the examining division (see point III above).

With the statement setting out the grounds of appeal the appellant furthermore submitted the following item of evidence:

Declaration of Dr Masters dated 6 November 2011

VI. In a communication dated 11 September 2015 issued in preparation for oral proceedings, the Board noted in the context of inventive step that the comparative data submitted with the Declaration of Dr Masters did not support the alleged effect of improved mechanical strength over the closest prior art D1. Consequently, with respect to claim 2 of the main request, the objective technical problem appeared to be the provision of an alternative process for the production of a protein matrix to that of D1, example 2, and the solution appeared obvious. Furthermore, the Board expressed the preliminary opinion that none of the amendments proposed according to the auxiliary requests would appear to lead to a different conclusion.

VII. Oral proceedings were held on 1 October 2015 in the absence of the appellant as announced with letter of 30 September 2015.

VIII. The appellant's arguments can be summarised as follows:

Main request

It was the method of manufacture which imparted the advantageous physical properties to the protein matrix material of the invention. The declaration of Dr Masters demonstrated that the material of claim 1, by virtue of its method of manufacture according to claim 2, was different from that disclosed in example 2 of D1, and displayed comparatively enhanced maximum tensile strength. As far as the process of preparation was concerned, D1 failed to disclose the features (c), (d) and (e) of claim 2. Claims 1 and 2 were thus novel. Inventive step was supported by the data provided in the declaration Dr Masters.

Auxiliary requests

Since the process claim according to the first, second, third and fifth auxiliary requests was identical to that of the main request, the arguments submitted in respect of the main request applied. Claim 1 of the sixth auxiliary request was further distinguished from D1 by the limited solvent content of the product, and was inventive by virtue of the unexpected advantageous properties conferred on the product, as demonstrated by the declaration of Dr Masters.

IX. The appellant requested in writing that the decision under appeal be set aside and a patent be granted on the basis of the set of claims of the main request, or alternatively on the basis of the sets of claims of the first to sixth auxiliary requests, all filed with the statement setting out the grounds of appeal.

  "reasoning": "1. **Identify the closest prior art** – The Board and the examining division agreed that document D1 (US‑A‑5,418,222) is the closest prior art. D1 discloses collagen (protein) films that are partially dried, contain a plasticiser (e.g., glycerol) and are subsequently compressed to form a protein matrix for sustained‑release applications.\n\n2. **Compare the claimed subject‑matter with D1** – The independent claim of the first auxiliary request (and the main request) differs from D1 mainly in:\n   - a defined final solvent content of the product (30 %–50 % in the auxiliary request, 10 %–60 % in the main request) whereas D1 merely teaches a range of 10 %–30 % glycerol;\n   - a pressure range for compression of 689 kPa to 689 500 kPa (100 psi to 100 000 psi) and a time range of 2 s to 48 h, while D1 does not specify these parameters.\n\n3. **Technical effect of the distinguishing features** – The appellant relied on a declaration (Dr Masters) to argue that the claimed process yields a material with higher tensile strength and delayed degradation. The Board (see point VI) found that the comparative data did not convincingly demonstrate such an effect. Consequently, no reliable technical advantage could be derived from the differences.\n\n4. **Formulate the objective technical problem** – Because no credible improvement over D1 is established, the objective problem is merely to provide an alternative way of producing a solvated compressed protein matrix material – i.e., to replace the undefined compression conditions of D1 with any set of pressure‑time‑solvent‑content parameters that achieve a non‑brittle cohesive body.\n\n5. **Assess obviousness** – A person skilled in the art, starting from D1, would recognise that:\n   - The solvent content of the final product can be varied within the broader range disclosed in the literature (including the 30 %–50 % range) without departing from the teaching of D1;\n   - Compression pressure and time are routine process variables in the preparation of protein films and can be adjusted by ordinary trial‑and‑error to obtain a desired solvent level. The ranges claimed are extremely wide and encompass values that would be tried by a skilled practitioner.\n   Hence, selecting the claimed pressure‑time‑solvent ranges would have been obvious.\n\n6. **Conclusion** – Both the examining division and the Board concluded that the claimed subject‑matter lacks an inventive step. The appellant’s arguments based on the declaration were not accepted as proof of a non‑obvious technical effect. Therefore, the invention does **not** satisfy the requirement of inventive step under Article 56 EPC.\n\n**Final answer:** No.",

Baseline Session for T256411 (Run 1) Finished. Verdict: NO

[LLM RESPONSE]:
{
  "reasoning": "1. The claimed invention relates to a specific crystalline form of (3R)-l-(2‑methylalanyl‑D‑tryptophyl)‑3‑(phenylmethyl)‑3‑piperidinecarboxylic acid 1,2,2‑trimethylhydrazide (anamorelin) and to a process for preparing it using methanol/water solvents (claims 1‑15). \n2. The closest technical prior art identified by the examining division is document D1 (US‑B‑6 576 648), which discloses the same compound but only in an amorphous form and does not disclose the specific crystalline polymorph, its X‑ray powder diffraction pattern, or the particular recrystallisation process using methanol/water mixtures. \n3. The examining division initially held that the claimed crystalline form was obvious because it would be routine to recrystallise the amorphous material obtained in step j of example 1 of D1. \n4. The appellant appealed. During the appeal the Board examined whether the skilled person, starting from D1, would have been motivated to carry out the specific recrystallisation steps (methanol or methanol‑water mixtures, temperature range 65‑75 °C, cooling, etc.) that lead to the claimed dihydrate crystal with the defined diffraction pattern. \n5. The Board concluded that D1 does not provide any teaching or hint to use the particular solvent system, temperature range, or to obtain the specific dihydrate form. The cited experimental data (X‑ray pattern) are not disclosed or suggested by D1. Consequently, the claimed crystalline form and its preparation are not derivable in an obvious manner from D1. \n6. The unrelated document describing data‑storage methods (the \"closest prior art\" supplied in the case data) is clearly irrelevant to the chemical/pharmaceutical subject matter and cannot be used to combine with D1 to render the invention obvious. \n7. Because the claimed subject‑matter is not directly and unambiguously disclosed, nor rendered obvious by the combination of the available teachings, the invention involves an inventive step under Article 56 EPC. \n8. The Board therefore allowed the main request, indicating that the claims meet the requirements of the EPC, including inventive step. \n9. As the main request was granted, the case concludes that the invention satisfies the inventive‑step requirement.",

{
  "reasoning": "1. Identify the closest prior art (D1). D1 discloses a wireless internet remote access platform that provides mobile users with remote centralized storage and computation. It teaches that a mobile device can request services on a remote server, obtain file listings, and retrieve files after providing credentials.\\n2. Compare the features of claim 1 with D1. The claim requires: (a) receiving a user instruction to attach a file; (b) requesting a file‑browsing service on a file‑delivery server; (c) prompting for and furnishing access credentials; (d) presenting the file list on the hand‑held device; (e) receiving a second user instruction to send the e‑mail; (f) sending to a mail agent an attachment instruction that contains the file identifier and the credentials; (g) the mail agent retrieving the file from the server and assembling the complete e‑mail.\\n3. D1 already teaches steps (b)–(d): a mobile device can request a file‑browsing service, be prompted for credentials, and receive a list of files.\\n4. The remaining steps (a), (e)–(g) relate to e‑mail composition. It is common general knowledge that mobile devices can compose e‑mail messages and that an e‑mail client can attach a file that resides on a remote server by sending a reference (or by retrieving the file using supplied credentials). The combination of a remote‑file‑access platform (as taught by D1) with the well‑known practice of attaching files to e‑mail is therefore obvious to the skilled person.\\n5. The only distinguishing wording in the auxiliary requests is the replacement of \"in response to receiving the user instruction\" with \"subsequent to receiving the user instruction\" or its omission. This does not add a technical effect and does not overcome the obviousness.\\n6. The board’s preliminary opinion explicitly maintained objections under Article 56 EPC based on D1 and the skilled person’s common general knowledge, indicating that the Board considered the subject‑matter obvious. No evidence in the case file shows that the Board was persuaded otherwise.\\n7.

Both documents disclose a turbo‑encoder, a rate‑matcher, separate handling of systematic and parity bits, interleaving, and mapping of bits to modulation symbols.\n\n2. **Determine the distinguishing features of claim 1**:\n   - The first interleaver writes systematic bits *row‑by‑row* from first to last row; the second interleaver writes parity bits *row‑by‑row*.\n   - After the row‑wise write, each interleaver performs an *inter‑column permutation* according to a determined rule.\n   - The modulator *alternately collects* the permuted bits *column‑by‑column* from the two interleavers.\n   - The two interleavers have the *same size*.\n   - If the number of systematic bits exceeds the capacity of the first interleaver, the excess bits are written into the second interleaver.\n\n3. **Formulate the objective technical problem**: To provide a method of arranging the storage and ordering of systematic and parity bits after rate‑matching such that the bits can be efficiently mapped onto modulation symbols (e.g., 16‑QAM) while handling cases where the amount of systematic bits is larger than the allocated buffer.\n\n4. **Assess whether the solution is obvious**:\n   - D7 already teaches the use of separate interleavers for systematic and parity bits and the use of matrix‑style interleaving (row‑wise write, column‑wise read) in the LTE/UMTS standard. The concept of performing an inter‑column permutation is a routine variation of matrix interleaving known to the skilled person.\n   - D2 teaches *enhanced symbol mapping* based on bit priority, i.e., giving precedence to systematic bits when mapping to symbols. This naturally leads a skilled designer to consider overflow handling – placing surplus systematic bits into the parity‑bit buffer – as a straightforward engineering solution.\n   - The requirement that the two interleavers have the same size is a simple design choice to simplify hardware implementation and is routinely adopted in standardised radio‑access specifications.\n   - Combining these teachings, a person skilled in the art would arrive at the claimed arrangement without any inventive contribution: use the known row‑wise write, column‑wise read matrix, add an inter‑column permutation (a routine modification), keep the buffers equal in size for symmetry, and redirect excess systematic bits to the parity buffer – all of which are routine adaptations of the teachings of D2 and D7.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The distinguishing features are either directly disclosed or would be obvious modifications of the teachings of D2 in combination with D7. Consequently, the claimed subject‑matter lacks an inventive step under Article 56 EPC.\n\n**Final answer**: No, the claimed invention does not satisfy the requirement of an inventive step.",

  "reasoning": "1. **Closest prior art** – The Board (and the Examining Division) identified Grafton® DBM Crunch (document 19) as the closest prior art. This product is a blend of demineralised bone fibres and cortical bone cubes and is supplied without any covering or delivery system.\n\n2. **Distinguishing features of claim 1** – The claim adds a tubular delivery system whose covering (i) is made of a poly(glycolic acid) (PGA) mesh, (ii) includes a physical attachment mechanism (wrap, suture, wire, etc.), and (iii) retains the DBM mixture inside the covering while allowing transfer of the substance on implantation.\n\n3. **Objective technical problem** – Starting from Grafton® DBM Crunch, the problem can be formulated as: *how to provide a delivery system that improves handling/placement of the DBM mixture at the surgical site*.\n\n4. **Known solutions** – Documents (2) EP‑A‑82621, (7) US‑A‑2004/220615 and (17) WO 2008/013763 disclose porous mesh coverings (often PGA) for bone‑related implants and describe various attachment means (wraps, sutures, cable ties, etc.). These teachings are directed to the very features that differentiate the claim – a mesh covering with an attachment mechanism that retains a bone‑related substance and can be subdivided intra‑operatively.\n\n5. **Combination of teachings** – A skilled person seeking to improve the handling of a DBM product would readily consider applying the known mesh‑covering concepts to the DBM mixture. The combination does not require any inventive insight because:\n   - the mesh material (PGA) and its degradable nature are disclosed;\n   - the attachment mechanisms are explicitly listed in the prior art;\n   - the function of retaining a bone‑substituting substance inside a tubular sheath is a straightforward adaptation of the teachings for other bone‑implant carriers.\n\n6. **Applicant’s argument of unexpected effect** – The applicant relies on a declaration (Dr D. Shimko) showing that a specific commercial system (Magnifuse® DBM) performed better than Grafton® DBM Crunch. However, the declaration is not part of the case file and no quantitative data are reproduced. Moreover, the alleged improvement is attributed to the presence of the mesh covering, which the skilled person would already consider as a means to improve handling and possibly release kinetics. The cited teaching (23) that a barrier might be undesirable does not preclude the use of a degradable mesh, because the same documents (2), (7) and (17) teach that such meshes are intended to be bio‑resorbable and to permit tissue ingrowth. Consequently, the alleged “counter‑intuitive” effect is not sufficient to render the combination non‑obvious.\n\n7. **Conclusion** – The distinguishing features are directly and unambiguously disclosed in the cited prior‑art documents, and their combination with a known DBM product would have been obvious to the skilled person seeking a better delivery system. The alleged unexpected technical effect is not convincingly proven within the proceedings. Therefore, the invention does not meet the requirement of an inventive step under Article 56 EPC.",

  "reasoning": "1. **Identify the closest prior art** – The examining division and the appellant agree that D1 (US 2005/0262338) is the closest document. D1 discloses lottery tickets that carry a unique validation code and a system in which a first key (or code) is generated for each ticket, stored at a central server, and later used to authenticate tickets across a network.\n\n2. **Determine the distinguishing features of claim 1** – Compared with D1, claim 1 adds:\n   - the generation of a *first encryption code* from the validation code before the tickets reach the lottery provider;\n   - the storage of this first encryption code at the provider;\n   - the later generation of a *second encryption code* from a validation code submitted by a player;\n   - a comparison of the second encryption code with the stored first encryption code to decide whether the ticket is eligible for a second‑chance game or an end‑of‑game drawing;\n   - the registration of the ticket in a second record only when a match is found.\n\n3. **Formulate the objective technical problem** – The problem can be phrased as: “How to provide a secure, computer‑based method that allows a player to enter a validation code of an already‑sold lottery ticket into a second‑chance game without exposing the plain‑text validation codes to the lottery provider.”\n\n4. **Look for teaching in the prior art that would lead to the solution** –\n   - **D2** (US 2006/0059363) discloses the generation of hash values (or encrypted codes) for stored data and the comparison of a hash of newly submitted data with the stored hash to verify identity. This is exactly the “encrypt‑and‑compare” concept used in claim 1.\n   - **D4** (UNIX password handling) teaches that passwords are stored only in encrypted form and that a submitted password is encrypted with the same algorithm and compared with the stored encrypted value. This is a further, well‑known illustration of the same principle.\n   - Both D2 and D4 are generic computer‑science teachings that are routinely applied by a skilled person when a need arises to protect secret data.\n\n5. **Combine the teachings** – A skilled person starting from D1 would already have a system where each ticket carries a unique validation code and where a central server stores data related to the ticket. Faced with the problem of protecting that validation code, the skilled person would naturally look to the well‑known hash/ encryption techniques disclosed in D2 (or D4) and would apply them to the validation code: generate an encrypted (hash) value of the code, store it, later encrypt the player‑submitted code and compare the two values. The remaining steps of registering a matching ticket for a second‑chance draw are routine business‑logic that would be added by the skilled person once the secure comparison mechanism is in place.\n\n6. **Assess obviousness** – The combination of D1 (lottery ticket with unique code) with the generic hash‑comparison teaching of D2 (or the password‑hash teaching of D4) would have been obvious to a person skilled in the art of lottery‑system IT. No technical teaching is provided in the prior art that suggests using the *same* validation code for a primary game and a secondary game while keeping the plain‑text code hidden; however, the skilled person would recognise that the same hash‑comparison technique can be reused for any subsequent game that relies on the same identifier. The board’s provisional opinion that the invention lacks inventive step in view of a “notorious lottery game” and D4 therefore aligns with this analysis.\n\n7. **Conclusion** – Because the distinguishing features of claim 1 are directly and obviously derived from the combination of D1 with the well‑known hash/encryption teachings of D2 (and D4), the claimed method does **not** involve an inventive step under Article 56 EPC.\n\n**Answer:** No",

  "reasoning": "Step 1: Identify the closest prior art. Document D1 discloses a logical bill‑of‑material (GBOM) that represents relationships between parent‑product variants and component‑product variants using compatibility matrices and rules. Document D3 discloses product modelling with STEP, i.e. hierarchical assembly structures stored in a computer‑based data model for CAD/CAM environments. These two documents together provide the technical background most relevant to the claimed subject‑matter.\n\nStep 2: Compare the claim with D1/D3. Claim 1 of the main request requires a product data‑model stored in memory that (i) contains a parent assembly and at least two children, (ii) defines component‑usages operatively connected to a component of the parent assembly, (iii) defines logical component‑usages operatively connected to the component‑usages, and (iv) interconnects the parent assembly, component‑usages and logical component‑usages hierarchically. \n\n- D1 already teaches the notion of a logical component‑usage (the \"logical\" part of the GBOM) that captures compatibility/alternative relationships between component variants. \n- D3 teaches that a product data‑model for CAD/CAM can be stored in a computer memory and that assemblies are represented hierarchically with parts and their usages. \n- The combination of D1’s logical component‑usage concept with D3’s hierarchical CAD/CAM data‑model therefore yields all the features of claim 1: a parent assembly with children, component‑usages linked to the assembly, logical component‑usages linked to those component‑usages, and hierarchical interconnection.\n\nStep 3: Assess obviousness. A skilled person working in the field of CAD/CAM product data management would be familiar with STEP‑based hierarchical assembly models (D3) and with the GBOM approach for handling variant relationships (D1). Combining the two teachings to obtain a data‑model that explicitly stores logical component‑usages together with component‑usages in a hierarchical structure would be a straightforward, routine step. No teaching in the prior art is required to modify D3’s STEP model to include the logical component‑usage objects of D1; the modification is routine for a person seeking to manage product families with variant logic.\n\nStep 4: Look for any technical effect beyond the prior art. The appellant’s arguments focus on the “abstraction” of component‑usage into a lightweight copy and on reducing duplicate engineering data. These are merely organisational benefits of using a known data‑structuring technique; they do not produce a further technical effect (e.g., improved performance, reduced computation time, enhanced reliability) that would render the combination non‑obvious.\n\nStep 5: Consider post‑published D4. Document D4 was published after the filing date of the application and therefore cannot be taken into account as prior art for inventive‑step assessment. Its disclosure of a “lightweight copy” does not change the analysis of the earlier documents.\n\nConclusion: The subject‑matter of claim 1 (and consequently the dependent claims) is directly and obviously derivable from the combination of D1 and D3. The claimed invention therefore lacks an inventive step under Article 56 EPC.\n\nAnswer: No",

This document therefore provides the core teaching of associating input with DOM nodes and handling the input as events.  \n3. **Identify the missing features in D12** – D12 does not explicitly disclose (i) *simultaneous* input from two or more distinct regions, (ii) the notion of separate touch‑start/move/end events for each region, or (iii) the combination of those separate events into a higher‑level gesture event that is then sent to the page.  \n4. **Combine D12 with the other cited knowledge** – Document D2 (DOM Level 2 Events Specification) teaches a generic event model for web documents, including the ability to register listeners, capture, bubble and combine events. Moreover, the skilled person’s common general knowledge (as reflected in D10, D11 and the state of touch‑enabled browsers in 2007) includes the existence of touch‑start, touch‑move, touch‑end and touch‑cancel events and the possibility of handling multiple concurrent touch points.  \n5. **Obviousness assessment** – A skilled programmer, faced with D12’s ink‑annotation architecture, would readily recognise that the same mechanism can be extended from a single pen stroke to multiple simultaneous touch points by:   \n   - using the DOM event model of D2 to listen for touch‑start/move/end events on different DOM nodes,   \n   - treating each concurrent touch point as a separate event stream,   \n   - combining the streams in software to recognise a gesture (a routine step in touch‑interface programming), and   \n   - forwarding the resulting gesture event to the page via the standard event‑dispatch mechanisms already described in D2.  \n   This modification requires only routine implementation knowledge that would be possessed by a skilled person working in the field of web‑based touch interfaces. No technical effect beyond what is already taught by the combination of D12 (linking input to DOM nodes) and D2 (event handling) is demonstrated.  \n6. **Conclusion** – Because all features of claim 1 are either disclosed in D12 or would be obvious to combine with D2 and the common general knowledge, the claimed subject‑matter lacks an inventive step under Article 56 EPC.\n\n**Answer:** No, the claimed invention does not satisfy the requirement of an inventive step.",

None of these documents disclose a log‑structured file system (LFS) that implements two distinct data‑layout formats, one for SSDs and one for HDDs, nor the specific migration steps of (i) identifying related file data, (ii) copying it into a log of the LFS, and (iii) storing it in HDD regions defined by contiguous block numbers. They also do not disclose the \"write‑anywhere\" technique for SSDs combined with a \"sequential write\" technique for HDDs.\n\n2. Determine the distinguishing features of claim 1 over the prior art:\n   - Use of a log‑structured file system that controls the hybrid media.\n   - Two separate data‑layout formats (first for SSDs, second for HDDs).\n   - Migration performed by copying data into the LFS log before writing to HDD regions.\n   - Definition of HDD regions as contiguous ranges of file block numbers.\n   - Explicit \"write‑anywhere\" technique for SSDs and \"sequential write\" technique for HDDs.\n\n3.

While hybrid SSD/HDD systems and data migration are known (as shown in the dual‑media device), the prior art does not teach the use of an LFS to manage both media with two dedicated layout formats, nor the specific region‑based placement on HDDs that preserves block‑number contiguity. The combination of a log‑structured approach (normally used for SSDs) with a sequential‑write strategy for HDDs, together with the defined migration steps, is not suggested or motivated by the cited documents. The skilled person would not have a reason to replace the generic storage controller of the dual‑media device with an LFS that imposes the two layout formats and the region concept.\n\n4.

  "reasoning": "1. **Identify the closest prior art** – Document D5 is recognised as the closest prior art because it discloses a system for supplying power to an LED load with a LED driver module and a current controller module that generates a temperature‑dependent feedback signal (UREG) by mixing a temperature feedback signal and a current feedback signal.\n\n2. **Determine the distinguishing features** – Claim 1 differs from D5 in the following structural features:\n   - (i) the temperature feedback signal is a voltage (VTF) generated by a *first operational amplifier* (U1);\n   - (ii) the current feedback signal is a voltage (VCF) generated by a *second operational amplifier* (U2);\n   - (iii) the two voltages are mixed to produce a feedback voltage (TDFB).\n   D5 does not disclose that either feedback signal is produced by an operational amplifier; it merely mentions a temperature regulation module (NTC) and an integrator whose output is a voltage, and an adder that feeds an operational‑amplifier used as a regulator. The Board in T 1983/09 explicitly stated that D5 is silent about the type of signal generated by the temperature regulation means and about the adder, i.e. D5 does not objectively disclose features (i)–(iii).\n\n3. **Formulate the objective technical problem** – Starting from D5, the problem is to provide a simpler, more responsive feedback‑control arrangement that yields continuous current regulation over a wide temperature range.\n\n4. **Assess obviousness** – To arrive at the claimed solution the skilled person would have to replace the temperature‑regulation block and the integrator of D5 with two separate operational amplifiers, each dedicated to generate a voltage feedback signal, and then mix the two voltages. \n   - The only document cited by the Examining Division to suggest such a modification is D6, which the Division used to argue that the skilled person would “always consider the use of operational amplifiers for processing the measured signals”.

Determine whether the patent fulfils the inventive step criteria or not.=== CASE DATA ===
--- APPEAL FACTS ---
I. The applicant (appellant) filed an appeal against the decision of the Examining Division posted on 8 August 2008 refusing European patent application No. 03076109.2.

II. The decision made reference to the following documents:

D1: Wongvasu N. et al.: "Representing the relationship between items in logical bill-of-material to support customers' requests for quotation for make-to-order products", Proceedings of SPIE, Vol. 4192, p. 74-85 (2000); and

D3: Gu P. et al.: "Product modelling using STEP", Computer-Aided Design, Vol. 27, No. 3, p. 163-179, (March 1995).

The Examining Division decided that the main request contravened Article 123(2) EPC, that claim 1 of the first auxiliary request lacked an inventive step over a combination of documents D1 and D3, but also without reference to a document, and that the second auxiliary request again contravened Article 123(2) EPC.

III. With the statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant filed a copy of the post-published document

D4: Callahan S.: "Extended Generic Product Structure: An Information Model for Representing Product Families", Journal of Computing and Information Science in Engineering, Vol. 6, p. 263-275 (September 2006).

The appellant further indicated that a declaration by an expert in the field was expected to be filed soon. No such declaration has been submitted.

The appellant requested that the decision be set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of a main request or, in the alternative, on the basis of a first or a second auxiliary request. According to the statement of grounds of appeal, the main request corresponded to the first auxiliary request as filed in the first-instance proceedings and the first auxiliary request corresponded to the second auxiliary request as filed in the first-instance proceedings.

IV. The claims of the main request, the first auxiliary request ("auxiliary request I") and the second auxiliary request ("auxiliary request II") were filed on 22 December 2008 together with the "confirmation copy" of the statement of grounds of appeal, i.e. after expiry of the time limit for the statement of grounds of appeal. The claims of the main request corresponded to those of the first auxiliary request before the department of first instance. Claim 1 of auxiliary request I corresponded to claim 1 of the second auxiliary request before the department of first instance. The dependent claims of auxiliary request I differed from those of the second auxiliary request before the department of first instance.

V. The Board appointed oral proceedings. In a communication accompanying the summons to oral proceedings, the Board provisionally expressed a negative opinion on all requests. Among other objections, claim 1 of both the main request and auxiliary request I appeared to lack an inventive step. Questions were raised regarding the admissibility of auxiliary request II.

VI. With a letter dated 11 February 2014, the appellant informed the Board that it would not appear at the oral proceedings. The letter did not address any of the issues raised in the communication accompanying the summons.

VII. The oral proceedings were held on 10 March 2014 in the absence of the appellant. At the end of the oral proceedings the chairman announced the decision of the Board.

VIII. Claim 1 of the main request reads as follows:

"A method of designing products using CAD and of manufacturing products using CAM, wherein a product data-model is stored in a memory associated with a computer, said product data-model representing product information about at least one component that is a constituent of at least one parent assembly, comprising:

a parent assembly and two or more children, each comprising at least one component, said parent assembly holding information for associating the two children with the parent assembly;

a plurality of component-usages for holding information relating to usages of the component, said component-usages being operatively connected to a component of the parent assembly;

a plurality of logical component-usages for holding information relating to logical usages of the component, said logical component-usages being operatively connected to said component-usages; and

said parent assembly, said component-usages and said logical component-usages being hierarchically interconnected."

IX. Claim 1 of auxiliary request I reads as follows:

"A method of designing products using CAD and of manufacturing products using CAM, wherein a product data-model is stored in a memory associated with a computer, said product data-model representing product information about at least one component that is a constituent of at least one parent assembly, said data model comprising a parent assembly and two or more children, said parent assembly holding information for associating the two children with the parent assembly, said method comprising:

selecting one component-usage to be included in a product configuration from a plurality of component-usages in said data model and for holding information relating to usages of the component;

selecting one from the component-usages connected to it from a plurality of logical component-usages of said data model and for holding information relating to logical usages of the component, said logical component-usages being operatively connected to said component-usages; wherein said logical component-usages are used to identify the existence of a role for said component-usages in an assembly configuration represented by a general motional [sic] mechanism for expressing to which particular configuration each logical component-usage and component-usage is applicable, the logical component usages are labeled with applicability attributes (O1, O2) that determine whether they apply to a given product configuration, including option attributes (O1, O2) of which the options are mutually exclusive."

X. Claim 1 of auxiliary request II reads as follows:

"A method for representing assembly configurations using a generalized occurrence structure stored in a memory, comprising:

(a) constructing a plurality of occurrence nodes corresponding to paths in a representation of a product data-model comprising hierarchically interconnected parent assembly, a plurality of component-usages, and a plurality of logical component-usages;

(b) constructing a plurality of logical occurrence nodes associated with a plurality of said occurrence nodes;

(c) storing product data in said occurrence nodes;

(d) associating a plurality of part-interfaces with said occurrence nodes;

(e) associating a plurality of part usages with a plurality of logical occurrence nodes depending upon logical relationships between said part-usages; and

(f) forming a mapping of a plurality of computer-aided designs of said parts with said product data-model

wherein said step (a) further comprises

forming a mapping of at least one manufacturing assembly sequence to at least one computer-aided-design that is stored in said product data model, said manufacturing assembly sequence comprising a plurality of manufacturing assemblies which include a plurality of components and a plurality of assemblies, wherein it is ensured by an effectivity or applicability scheme that for any one valid assembly configuration of the parent assembly 12 using the logical component usage node 18, there is only one component usage node 14, the logical component usage node 18 determining which one of the multiple (if any) component usage nodes 14 associated with it becomes part of a given valid assembly configuration of the parent assembly 12."

XI. In support of inventive step, the appellant essentially argued as follows:

The data models described in the claims were used in the technical field of computer-aided design systems and computer-aided manufacturing environments. In this technical field virtual product modelling could expedite a design process for a family of products sharing an overall product architecture. The designer could customise the product selected from a product family that included many product variants.

Before the present invention, a designer reconstructed relationships between product design domains, either mentally or with some minimal computer support. Manual tracking of such relationships incurred high costs and was prone to errors. Reduced use of effectivity, viz. defining which part went into each end product configuration, meant diminishing knowledge of what was common among different product designs.

The invention avoided the undesirable situation where there were many copies of engineering bill-of-material assembly definitions that were similar but had unique copies of product structure definitions. In addition, multiple and independent drawings, CAD data and product structures for variance were eliminated.

The "logical component usage" concept was used to check the consistency of the selection of component usages and was a mechanism to help designers understand which component usages were alternative to each other, versus which component usages fulfilled different purposes in the design.

The present invention introduced logical component usage as an abstraction of component usage. In the prior art a component usage was considered to be a relationship object. It was counter-intuitive to consider abstracting a relationship.

The invention introduced the idea of considering a component usage as a lightweight copy of a component instead of as a relationship. This allowed component usage to be abstracted, since it had become a virtual thing instead of a relationship. This concept of a lightweight copy was further introduced in document D4.

TITLE: Representing the relationship between items in logical
bill-of-material to support customers’ request for quotation for
make-to-order products

TYPE: Academic Paper

ABSTRACT: 

For make-to-order products in which the specification of some component-product variants are to be defined by
customers, it is almost impossible to develop a bill-of-material system that support customers’ requests for quotation
(RFQ) response activities usingthe existingbill-of-material concepts. To deal with this problem, a new technique
for representingthe relationship between parent-product variants and component-product variants in the generic
bill-of-material (GBOM) structure is developed. The new technique is based on an assumption that the relationship
between any two components in a product structure has pairwise independent property. The technique represents the
relationship with compatibility constraints in the form of matrices and rules. The new representation provides users
with a means to describingvariants of make-to-order products as well as supportingthe customers’ RFQ response
activities with only a limited amount of data which is comprehensive, easy to maintain, and easy to understand.

--- APPEAL FACTS ---
I. This appeal ("second appeal") is against the decision of the examining division ("second decision"), posted on 30 November 2010, to refuse European patent application No. 02028629.0 on the grounds that the prior art was not properly acknowledged (Rule 27(1)(b) EPC 1973), that the two-part form was not properly provided (Rule 29(1)(a)(b) EPC 1973), and that the subject-matter of the application lacked an inventive step (Article 56 EPC) with respect to a main request, a first auxiliary request, and a second auxiliary request, having regard to the disclosure of

D2: "Enhanced Symbol Mapping method for the

modulation of Turbo-coded bits based on bit

priority", 3GPP TSG RAN WG1/WG2 Joint Meeting

D2: "Enhanced Symbol Mapping method for the,

and the skilled person's common general knowledge as evidenced by

D7: "TS 25.212 V1.0.0", 3GPP TSG RAN WG1,

Multiplexing and channel coding (FDD), pp. 1-38,

April 1999.

A previous appeal ("first appeal") against the former decision of the examining division ("first decision"), posted on 16 February 2009, to refuse the present patent application on the grounds that the prior art was not properly acknowledged (Rule 42(1)(b) EPC), that the two-part form was not properly provided (Rule 43(1) EPC), and that the claims lacked clarity (Article 84 EPC) with respect to a sole request was settled by a decision, taken by this board in an entirely different composition ("the former board"), ordering that the first decision be set aside, that the case be remitted to the examining division for further prosecution, and that the appeal fee be reimbursed following a substantial procedural violation committed by the examining division (cf. T 1123/09). As to the reasoning of that decision, the former board held inter alia that the appellant had the right to amend the description to acknowledge the respective prior-art documents following the objection raised by the examining division under Rule 27(1)(b) EPC 1973 (cf. point 3), that the formulation of the pending independent claims in the two-part form had to be postponed (cf. point 4), that the objected claims were clear (cf. point 6), and that the examining division had committed a substantial procedural violation in using new and unsupported principles with regard to the application of

Rule 27(1)(b) EPC 1973 (Rule 42(1)(b) EPC) in that case (cf. point 8).

II. Notice of appeal was received on 10 February 2011. The appeal fee was paid on the same day. With the statement setting out the grounds of appeal, received on 8 April 2011, the appellant filed new claims according to a main request, a first auxiliary request, and a second auxiliary request. It requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of the main request or any of the auxiliary requests. In addition, oral proceedings were requested as an auxiliary measure.

III. A summons to oral proceedings scheduled for 1 October 2013 was issued on 11 July 2013. In an annex to this summons, the board expressed its preliminary opinion on the appeal pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA. In particular, objections were raised by the board under Articles 123(2) and 56 EPC, in view of D2 and D7.

IV. With a letter of reply dated 30 August 2013, the appellant filed amended claims according to a main request and an auxiliary request. It also submitted arguments as to why D7 did not disclose the established distinguishing features and advised that a "more detailed explanation" would be provided during the oral proceedings.

V. Oral proceedings were held as scheduled on 1 October 2013, during which the former main and auxiliary requests were replaced by a new main request (claims 1 to 8) as a sole request in response to objections raised by the board under Articles 123(2) and 56 EPC. The main request was admitted into the appeal proceedings and its patentability was discussed.

The appellant's final request was that the decision under appeal be set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of the main request as filed during the oral proceedings before the board. At the end of the oral proceedings, the board announced its decision.

VI. Claim 1 of the main request reads as follows:

"An apparatus for data transmission in a communication system, comprising:

a turbo encoder (220) for turbo coding data bits to generate systematic bits and parity bits;

a rate matcher (230) for rate matching the systematic bits and parity bits;

a first and second interleaver (250, 260) for separately writing the rate-matched systematic bits and the rate-matched parity bits; and

a modulator (280) for alternately mapping bits collected from the first interleaver and the second interleaver onto one modulation symbol according to a modulation scheme,

characterized in that

the first interleaver is arranged for writing the rate-matched systematic bits row by row from a first row to a last row, and the second interleaver is arranged for writing the rate-matched parity bits row by row from a first row to a last row, wherein the first and second interleavers are arranged for then separately interleaving the systematic bits and the parity bits by performing inter-column permutation, respectively, according to a determined rule,

wherein the modulator is arranged for alternately collecting the permutated bits column by column in the first interleaver and the second interleaver, and

wherein in case that a number of the rate-matched systematic bits is too large for them to be written into the first interleaver, the excessive number of rate-matched systematic bits is written in the second interleaver."

The further independent claim 4 of the main request is directed to a corresponding method, while independent claims 7 and 8 are directed to a complementary apparatus and method, respectively.

TITLE: Adaptive HARQ for fixed TTI using soft acknowledgement

TYPE: Working Group Document

DOCUMENT:

We showed a physical layer structure and coding scheme that combines the advantages of the conventional fixed 
and variable TTI proposals by allowing to use two parallel data streams for each TTI. The main benefits are: 
• flexible mapping of required retransmission energy using MCS level and code rate adaptation, as 
well as bit mapping, 
• reduced interference, 
• allows soft-combining of retransmissions at different MCS levels,
• high frame fill efficiency, 
• increased throughput, 
• maintains simplicity of fixed TTI. 
The concepts presented in this paper are suitable for incremental redundancy, but can also be adapted to Chase 
combining.

TITLE: Design and implementation of a wireless internet remote access platform

TYPE: Academic Paper

ABSTRACT:

Recently, mobile networks and internet technologies have been widely developed for the voice communication and information retrieval services all over the world. Compared with the wire-line internet environment, mobile networks have lower bandwidth, longer transmission latency and unreliable connection, and the capability of mobile terminals is restricted by the limited memory size, lower CPU computation capability and inconvenient I/O interface. These limitations restrict the development of the wireless internet applications. In this paper, we design and implement a ‘wireless internet remote access platform’ (WIRAP). The WIRAP platform interconnects the wireless network and internet to provide mobile users a remote centralized storage and computation environment. A mobile user can store large volume of data and execute complex computations on WIRAP instead of on the mobile terminals. WIRAP supports different network interfaces (e.g. short message service (SMS), wireless markup language (WML) and hyper text markup language (HTML) and users may use terminals (with different network capabilities) to access WIRAP.

--- APPEAL FACTS ---
I. The appeal lies from the decision of the Examining Division refusing European patent application No. 08 873 572.5.

II. Inter alia the following documents were cited in the examination proceedings:

(2) EP-A-82621,

(7) US-A-2004/220615,

(17) WO 2008/013763 and

(19) http://www.orthosupersite.com/images/content/OT/200505/DBM.pdf (pdf dated May 2005).

III. In the decision under appeal, the Examining Division found that that the subject-matter of the then pending main request did not fulfil the requirements of Articles 123(2) and 56 EPC. More particularly, it found that claim 1 of said request found a basis in the application as filed, but not the late-filed drawings. With regard to inventive step, a demineralised bone matrix (DBM) of document (19) represented the closest prior art, the subject-matter of said claim not being inventive thereover in the light of documents (2), (7) and/or (17), which taught porous mesh coverings for bone implants.

IV. With letter dated 23 January 2017, the Appellant (Applicant) submitted a main request and auxiliary requests 1 to 3 and 4a to 4d and withdrew the request made before the Examining Division to insert figures 13a to 13g into the specification. During oral proceedings before the Board, held on 23 February 2017, it filed a new main request, replacing the previous main request.

V. The Appellant submitted that the subject-matter of all requests complied with the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC. By withdrawing the request to insert figures 13a to 13g into the specification, the objections in point 12 of the contested decision under Article 123(2) EPC were overcome. With regard to inventive step, the product Grafton® DBM Crunch of document (19) represented the closest prior art. The declaration of Dr. D. Shimko filed with letter dated 23 January 2017 containing further experimental data comparing a delivery system according to the invention, namely Magnifuse® DBM, with said product, showed a performance improvement for Magnifuse® DBM over Grafton® DBM Crunch. Said improvement was unexpected, since at the date of filing of the present application it would have been counter-intuitive and gone against accepted teachings in this field for the skilled person seeking to promote bone fusion at a grafting site, to provide the bone products with a mesh covering which would act as a barrier between the bone products and the bone, inter alia document (23) being cited in this respect:

(23) D. G. Marchesi: "Spinal fusions: bone and bone substitutes", Eur. Spine J., 2000, 9, pages 372 to 378.

The skilled person would not have turned to the teachings of documents (2), (7) and/or (17) when seeking to develop an improved bone void filler product to maximise bone tissue regeneration. The claimed subject-matter was thus inventive.

VI. The Appellant requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of the main request as filed during oral proceedings before the Board, or, subsidiarily, on the basis of any of the auxiliary requests 1 to 3 and 4a to 4d as filed with letter dated 23 January 2017.

VII. At the end of the oral proceedings, the decision of the Board was announced.

--- APPEAL FACTS ---
I. This is an appeal against the refusal of European patent application No. 07 841 130 for lack of inventive step (Article 56 EPC 1973).

II. The applicant requested in writing that the decision under appeal be set aside and a patent be granted on the basis of claims 1 to 11 filed with letter dated 27 October 2009, as sole request.

Oral proceedings were also requested.

III. Claim 1 of this request reads as follows:

"1. A method for implementing a second-chance game to or an end of game drawing for players of a lottery game, comprising the steps of:

providing tickets for the lottery game, wherein the tickets are each assigned a unique validation code;

applying an algorithm to generate a unique, first encryption code for each ticket validation code;

storing the first encryption code in a record at a lottery provider;

distributing the tickets for possession by players of the lottery game;

allowing players to submit the unique validation codes for registration into a lottery provider's database;

on the part of the lottery provider, applying the algorithm to the submitted validation codes to create a second encryption code for each submitted validation code;

on the part of the lottery provider, comparing the second encryption code with the record of first encryption codes to determine whether a match exists; and

on the part of the lottery provider, registering players for the second-chance game or for the end of game drawing when such players submit a validation code that results in a match."

Claims 2 to 11 are dependent on claim 1.

IV. The following documents are mentioned in this decision:

D1 = US 2005/0262338 A

D2 = US 2006/0059363 A

D4 = "The UNIX Programming Environment", Prentice-Hall Inc., 1984, pp. 52-53

V. The examining division essentially argued that:

- Document D1 disclosed a lottery game in which tickets with a unique validation code were provided and distributed to the players of the lottery game. The problem to be solved by the application could be formulated as providing an alternative cryptographic access and authentication scheme to the scheme suggested in D1. Document D2 disclosed the generation and storage of hashes which were compared to hashed submitted information. The skilled person starting from D1 would incorporate the cryptographic access and authentication scheme of D2 in an obvious manner into D1 for the purpose of solving the problem. The remaining features of the method of claim 1 were rules and schemes of playing games and did not contribute in the assessment of inventive step.

VI. The appellant argued in writing essentially as follows:

- The present invention provided a secure validation and authentication system, wherein the players could enter instant lottery tickets, such as scratch-off tickets, into a subsequent game. According to one exemplary form of the present invention, lottery tickets were printed with a unique validation code. Once the validation codes were generated, the numbers were converted into encrypted validation codes. Along with a record of the encrypted validation codes, the tickets were transferred to a lottery provider who stored the record of the encrypted validation codes. Finally, the lottery provider distributed the lottery tickets. By encrypting the unique validation codes, it could be assured that there would be no record of these unique validation codes being accessible to unauthorized persons. Only the encrypted validation codes (first encryption codes) were transferred to the lottery provider. Thus a secure and easily manageable system for conducting a second-chance game or an end of game drawing based on instant-win lottery tickets was provided, since only the validation code from a ticket in the first game had to be entered to participate in the second-chance game. The system generated a second encryption code from the entered validation code and compared it to the first encryption code that was generated for that particular validation code. If the first and second encryption codes matched, then the player was automatically entered into the second-chance game or end of game drawing, and was eligible for winning the game without having to actually present the lottery ticket for redemption.

- Document D1 was considered by the examining division to be the closest prior art. This document disclosed a rather complicated method for authenticating a ticket across a network, including a plurality of document-printing terminals. Document D2 related to a completely different field than the present invention and D1. D2 centered on the correct delivery of a computerized device to a specific end user. Thus, there was no reason why a skilled person would look into D2 to solve the problem of the invention. The flow of information from a lottery provider to ticket terminals and back to the lottery provider (as in D1), as well as the flow of information from the distributor of computerized devices to an end user (as in D2) were not compatible and a combination was certainly not obvious to the skilled person.

VII. In a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA annexed to the summons to oral proceedings, the board informed the appellant of its provisional opinion that it shared his view that the combination of documents D1 and D2 did not lead to the invention, but that it nevertheless considered the invention to lack an inventive step having regard to a notorious lottery game and the disclosure of D4.

VIII. In reply to the objections raised by the board the appellant argued essentially that:

- Document D4 disclosed a broad teaching of the well-known UNIX system to store an encrypted record of passwords and, upon receipt of a password from a user, encrypting the received password and comparing such encryption to the record of stored encrypted passwords to determine validity of the received password. However, security of the validation record in the lottery industry was paramount and the flow of the validation numbers and validation records between the three involved entities: the lottery ticket manufacturer, the lottery provider, and the lottery player, were critical. The interplay between these entities was a relevant feature of the invention which had no relation to the UNIX system. Likewise, the relationship between the primary lottery game and the second-chance game or end of game drawing with respect to security had to be taken into account.

- With the current method, the ticket manufacturer generated the initial validation codes and printed such codes on the tickets in plain text format. These validation codes were the means for authenticating tickets in the primary lottery game. A fraudster gaining access to the validation codes at the ticket manufacturer could potentially determine wherein and whereto winning tickets were distributed, and the particular plain-text code printed on the winning tickets. The ticket manufacturer thus had a strong interest for developing a second chance game that was both user-friendly and secure.

- Even if a fraudster at the game provider with access to the game provider's server were somehow able to access individual tickets, the record of encrypted validation codes was essentially worthless to such fraudster in attempting to discern whether or not a ticket was a winning ticket. The record of encrypted validation codes was never linked back to a record of actual validation codes at the lottery ticket manufacturer. Thus, a fraudster having stolen a pack of tickets and having access to the record of encrypted validation codes could not use this information for trying to find out which of these tickets was a winning one. For this, he also would need to have access to the encryption algorithm. But even if the fraudster at the game provider were to gain access to the encryption algorithm, he would only be able to generate an encrypted validation code, and possibly compare this encrypted code to the record transmitted to the game provider. However, this would provide no useful information to the fraudster.

- If one would draw parallels, such a fraudulent determination of important information would correspond to getting access to the record of encrypted passwords on the UNIX server side as well as to stealing the corresponding user passwords and/or even the encryption algorithm. Such a scenario would be fatal for the use of the UNIX system. More specifically, in the case of a UNIX system, if a fraudster got to know the password of the user, he could use this password for entering the UNIX files of said user. A fraudster would not even need to have access to the record of encrypted validation codes and/or the encryption algorithm. Stealing a user password and gaining access to the UNIX system therefore led to a completely different scenario. Thus, a skilled person would not resort to the method described in D4 when wanting to offer security to the provider and comfort to the player for a second chance game.

- The flow of encrypted and plain-text validation codes between the parties served for purposes of the second chance game while ensuring security in the primary game. Thus, the method according to the invention kept up with the existing security standard for a primary game while at the same time using the already existing information, i.e. the individual validation code on the ticket, to provide for a unique method of enabling a secondary game. Accordingly, the ticket itself did not need to be altered compared to a ticket offering only one game. Only a record of encryption codes had to be established at the lottery provider as well as an algorithm, which calculated an encryption code based on the validation code transmitted by the player to the provider for the purpose of comparing the respective encrypted codes. The skilled person - even when being aware of the UNIX system according to D4 - would not come up with such a solution, which encompassed two different games having each their own security system, which however were linked via the same validation code on the ticket.

IX. The oral proceedings were held on 5 November 2015. Neither the appellant nor his representatives were present on the date of the oral proceedings. In a telephone conversation held by the board's registrar the representative's secretary informed her that the representative that had signed the last submissions in appeal was on holiday and the representative that had filed the appeal was not yet in his office. Thus the oral proceedings were held in the absence of the appellant.

--- APPEAL FACTS ---
I. The applicant appealed against the decision of the Examining Division, dispatched on 13 May 2014, to refuse the European patent application No. 04769910.3. The statement setting out the grounds of appeal was received on 16 September 2014.

II. The Examining Division refused the second and third auxiliary requests which were remitted to it following a decision by the present Board of Appeal in a different composition in case T 1983/09.

III. In case T 1983/09 the Board considered that the amendments made at the appeal stage had substantially changed the factual framework of the contested decision, and that an additional search could have been required to determine the relevant prior art (see penultimate paragraph of item 5.1 of that decision).

IV. In the decision under appeal in the present case the Examining Division held that the application did not meet the requirements of Article 56 EPC, having regard to document US 6 400 101 B1 (D5) in combination with the common general knowledge of a skilled person.

V. The appellant requested in writing that the decision under appeal be set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of a set of claims filed with the statement of grounds of appeal and corresponding to the claims of the former second auxiliary request.

VI. Claim 1 according to the appellant's sole request reads as follows.

"A system (20) for supplying power to an LED load (10), the system (20) comprising:

a LED driver module (30) operable to regulate a flow of a LED current (ILED) through the LED load (10) as a function of a temperature-dependent feedback signal (TDFS); and

a current controller module (60) in electric communication with said LED driver module (30) to communicate the temperature-dependent feedback signal (TDFS) to said LED driver module (10),

wherein said current controller module (60) is operable to generate the temperature-dependent feedback signal (TDFB) as a function of an operating temperature of the LED load (10) and the flow of the LED current (ILED) through the LED load (10), and

wherein said current controller module (600) includes:

means for generating a temperature feedback signal (VTF) as a function of a sensed operating temperature of the LED load (10);

wherein the temperature feedback signal is a temperature feedback voltage (VTF) and said current controller module (600) includes: a first operational amplifier (U1) operable to generate the temperature feedback voltage (VTF) as a function of the operating temperature of the LED load (10);

means for generating a current feedback signal (VCF) as a function of a sensed flow of the LED current (ILED) through the LED load (10);

wherein the current feedback signal is a current feedback voltage (VCF) and said current controller module (60) includes: a second operational amplifier (U2) operable to generate the current feedback voltage (VCF) as a function of the flow of the LED current (ILED) through the LED load (10); and

means for mixing the temperature feedback signal (VTF) and the current feedback signal (VCF) to yield the temperature and current-dependent feedback signal (TDFB),

wherein the temperature and current-dependent feedback signal (TDFB) is a feedback voltage generated as a mixture of the temperature feedback voltage (VTF) and the current feedback voltage (VCF)."

Claims 2 to 14 are dependent on claim 1.

VII. The appellant's arguments as far as they are relevant for the present decision can be summarised as follows:

The request in this appeal corresponded to the second auxiliary request addressed in the decision under appeal.

Claim 1 involved an inventive step over the disclosure of D5, D6 (US2002/130786 A1) and the alleged, but unproven "knowledge of the skilled person".

In D5, there was no disclosure of the following features which were required by claim 1 :

(i) a means for generating a temperature feedback signal which is a temperature feedback voltage (VTF) generated by a first operational amplifier (U1),

(ii) a means for generating a current feedback signal which is a current feedback voltage (VCF) generated by a second operational amplifier (U2), and

(iii) a means for mixing those signals to yield a temperature and current-dependent feedback signal (TDFB) which is a feedback voltage generated as a mixture of the temperature feedback voltage (VTF) and the current feedback voltage (VCF).

In the decision in case T 1983/09 the Board of Appeal held that D5 did not objectively disclose features (i) and (ii) identified above. The Board also stated that "D5 is indeed silent about the type of signal generated by the temperature regulation means and about the adder connected to the inverting input of the regulation means". Thus, according to the Board, D5 did not objectively disclose a temperature feedback voltage, so that feature (iii), which mentioned such a "temperature feedback voltage", was not disclosed either.

In paragraph 3.1.2 of the contested decision the Examining Division agreed that features (i) and (ii) were not disclosed in D5, but concluded, as stated in paragraph 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 of the decision that feature (iii) was disclosed in D5. This conclusion was not correct and contrary to the findings of fact stated by the Board of Appeal in the Reasons for the Decision in the case T 1983/09.

By providing these features in combination with the remaining features recited in claim 1, the claimed system provided a simple current controller module which provided a continuous feedback control of the LED as a function of both the sensed operating temperature of the LED load and the LED current through the LED load. In particular, it provided continuous control (page 11 , line 31 to page 12, line 6 of the original specification) over a wide temperature range. The two operational amplifiers operated independently to generate the respective voltage signals, which were then mixed. The use of the two operational amplifiers provided substantially aligned current and temperature control, and enabled the system to respond rapidly to current and temperature fluctuations.

As shown in Figure 3 of the present specification, the LED load was continuously controlled over a wide temperature range, based on the selection of a respective operational relationship between the resistive value of the LED load operating temperature sensor and the current through the LED load.

This technical effect of continuous control of current supplied to a LED driver with respect to temperature over an operating temperature range, in particular over a wide temperature range, had application, for example, in LED luminaires providing high quality light of a desired tuned colour temperature.

The objective technical problem starting from D5 was to provide a more simplified responsive feedback control of the power supply to the LED load so as to provide a temperature dependent control of the current supplied to the LED which could be continuous control of current supplied dependent on temperature over the operating temperature range.

The purpose of the circuitry of D5 on the other hand was primarily to prevent the LED from destruction resulting from an increased ambient temperature. Figure 3 of D5 showed the relationship between the forward current of the LED and ambient temperature. The current was constant up to an ambient temperature of 70°C and then was linearly reduced up to a maximum ambient temperature of 100°C, at which temperature the forward current of the LED was switched off. There was no disclosure or hint in D5 to solve the problem of providing a temperature dependent control of the current supplied to the LED as a continuous control of current supplied dependent on temperature over the operating temperature range.

Referring to paragraph 3.1.4 of the contested decision, even though operational amplifiers might have been known generally, there was no hint to the skilled person in D5 or D6, or in the common general knowledge, to somehow introduce two respective operational amplifiers into the circuit of Figure 8 of D5 in the specific manner recited in claim 1 and to process the specific respective signals recited in claim 1 in order to solve the correctly formulated objective technical problem. Moreover, no evidence of the common general knowledge had been provided.

The examining division relied upon D6 to assert that the skilled person, starting from D5, would "always consider the use of operational amplifiers for processing the measured signals". This unsubstantiated assertion indicated that the Examining Division had wrongly used hindsight in their analysis of inventive step.

DOCUMENT DESCRIPTION:

In accordance with the analysis of the content of D5 in case T 1983/09 the Board considers that document D5 discloses a system for supplying power to an LED load (cf. column 5, line 51 and figure 8) e.g. traffic lights (cf. column 4, lines 33 and 34), the system comprising:

a LED driver module (comparator and transistor T) operable to regulate a flow of a LED current ILED through the LED load as a function of a temperature-dependent feedback signal UREG (cf. figure 8 and column 7, lines 13 to 27); and

a current controller module (Regulator) in electric communication with said LED driver module to communicate the temperature-dependent feedback signal UREG to said LED driver module.

The current controller module is operable to generate a temperature-dependent feedback signal UREG in response to an operating temperature (signal input to the adder connected to the inverting input of the regulator) and the flow of the LED current through the LED load (signal at the non-inverting input of the regulator). The current controller module includes means for generating a temperature feedback signal as a function of a sensed operating temperature of the LED load (see column 4, lines 18 to 21 and column 7, lines 13 to 16 and figure 8: NTC and temperature regulation module) and means for generating a current feedback signal as a function of a sensed flow of the LED current ILED through the LED load (cf. column 2, lines 57 to 62). The current feedback signal is a current feedback voltage (output of the integrator is necessarily a voltage since it is applied to an input of an operational amplifier used as a regulator).

The system further comprises means for mixing the temperature feedback signal and the current feedback voltage (see figure 8: adder at the input of the regulator and the regulator drawn as an operational amplifier) to yield a temperature and current-dependent feedback voltage UREG.

TITLE: An architecture for ink annotations on Web documents

TYPE: Academic Paper

ABSTRACT:

There have been recent improvements in document technologies like the standardization of object interfaces to access and manipulate the properties of Web documents. There has also been significant progress in pen based computing for recognition of digital ink in desktops, tablets and handheld devices. These have necessitated a need for further research on annotation architectures for digital documents, specifically pen-based annotation systems. This paper presents an attempt to leverage the new standards of DHTML and W3C DOM that are being gradually implemented by popular browsers, to build a prototype of an ink annotation system with common components across browsers. One of the primary goals in this study is to semantically link ink data with underlying document elements like text and images. The system has three components: a) ink capture and rendering b) Ink Understanding, which recognizes and associates ink with the underlying document; and c) Ink storage and retrieval.

--- APPEAL FACTS ---
I. The appeal of the applicant (appellant) lies from the decision of the examining division announced at oral proceedings on 6 May 2011 to refuse European patent application n° 01 922 258.7.

II. The documents cited during the examination proceedings included the following:

D1: US-A-5,418,222

D2: EP-A-0 485 210

D5: J. Cappello et al., J. Controlled Release, 53 (1998), pages 105-117

III. The decision was based on two sets of claims filed with letter of 6 April 2011 as main request, and during oral proceedings on 6 May 2011 as auxiliary request.

Independent claim 1 of the main request related to a solvated compressed protein matrix material.

Independent claim 2 of the main request read as follows:

"2. A method of making a solvated compressed protein matrix material, comprising the steps of:

(a) preparing a coatable composition comprising one or more biocompatible protein materials and one or more biocompatible solvents;

(b) coating the composition to form a film;

(c) partially drying the coated film to a solvent content of 20% to 80% until the coated film can be formed into a non-brittle cohesive body;

(d) forming said cohesive body; and

(e) compressing the cohesive body to reduce bulk solvent and form a protein matrix material."

Independent claim 1 of the first auxiliary request read as follows:

"1. A method of making a solvated compressed protein matrix material, comprising the steps of:

(a) preparing a coatable composition comprising one or more biocompatible protein materials and one or more biocompatible solvents;

(b) coating the composition to form a film;

(c) partially drying the coated film to a solvent content of 35% to 80% until the coated film can be formed into a non-brittle cohesive body;

(d) forming said cohesive body; and

(e) compressing the cohesive body at a pressure of 689kPa to 689,500kPa (100psi to 100,000psi) for a time period of from 2 seconds to 48 hours to reduce bulk solvent and form a protein matrix material, having a solvent content of 30% to 50%."

IV. In its decision the examining division held inter alia that both D1 and D5 were prejudicial to the novelty of claim 1 of the main request.

The claims of the first auxiliary request met the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC. Novelty was established over D1 by virtue of the limitation of the solvent content of the product to the range of from 30 to 50%, and in that the pressure applied according to D1 is not further specified.

Claim 1 of the first auxiliary request did not meet the requirements of Article 56 EPC. D1 was the closest prior art since it related to collagen films for improving the sustained release delivery of a pharmaceutical, particularly in the context of enhancing wound healing. There was no evidence on file showing that the matrix material according to claim 1 was superior to that of D1 as alleged in terms of its strength, delayed degradation, and controlled delivery of an active agent. The pressure and time ranges recited were so broad that it was unlikely that an improvement could arise therefrom, and the claimed lower limit of 30% for the final solvent content of the material was within the range of the general teaching of D1 to provide from 10-30% glycerol. The objective technical problem was thus the provision of an alternative process for producing a solvated compressed protein matrix material. Such a process was conventional for the skilled person starting from the teaching of D1.

V. With the statement setting out the grounds of appeal dated 7 November 2011, the appellant submitted six sets of claims consisting of a main request and auxiliary requests 1-3, 5 and 6. A fourth claim set was not submitted, although the statement of grounds mentioned how such a request would be constructed.

Independent claim 2 was identical in the main request and the first to fourth auxiliary requests, and corresponded to independent claim 1 of the fifth auxiliary request. This claim was identical to claim 2 of the main request refused by the examining division (see point III above).

Independent claim 1 of the sixth auxiliary request corresponded to claim 1 of the first auxiliary request refused by the examining division (see point III above).

With the statement setting out the grounds of appeal the appellant furthermore submitted the following item of evidence:

Declaration of Dr Masters dated 6 November 2011

VI. In a communication dated 11 September 2015 issued in preparation for oral proceedings, the Board noted in the context of inventive step that the comparative data submitted with the Declaration of Dr Masters did not support the alleged effect of improved mechanical strength over the closest prior art D1. Consequently, with respect to claim 2 of the main request, the objective technical problem appeared to be the provision of an alternative process for the production of a protein matrix to that of D1, example 2, and the solution appeared obvious. Furthermore, the Board expressed the preliminary opinion that none of the amendments proposed according to the auxiliary requests would appear to lead to a different conclusion.

VII. Oral proceedings were held on 1 October 2015 in the absence of the appellant as announced with letter of 30 September 2015.

VIII. The appellant's arguments can be summarised as follows:

Main request

It was the method of manufacture which imparted the advantageous physical properties to the protein matrix material of the invention. The declaration of Dr Masters demonstrated that the material of claim 1, by virtue of its method of manufacture according to claim 2, was different from that disclosed in example 2 of D1, and displayed comparatively enhanced maximum tensile strength. As far as the process of preparation was concerned, D1 failed to disclose the features (c), (d) and (e) of claim 2. Claims 1 and 2 were thus novel. Inventive step was supported by the data provided in the declaration Dr Masters.

Auxiliary requests

Since the process claim according to the first, second, third and fifth auxiliary requests was identical to that of the main request, the arguments submitted in respect of the main request applied. Claim 1 of the sixth auxiliary request was further distinguished from D1 by the limited solvent content of the product, and was inventive by virtue of the unexpected advantageous properties conferred on the product, as demonstrated by the declaration of Dr Masters.

IX. The appellant requested in writing that the decision under appeal be set aside and a patent be granted on the basis of the set of claims of the main request, or alternatively on the basis of the sets of claims of the first to sixth auxiliary requests, all filed with the statement setting out the grounds of appeal.

  "reasoning": "1. The closest prior art is D1, which discloses a wireless internet remote access platform (WIRAP) that provides mobile users with remote centralized storage and the ability to browse and retrieve files from a server.\n2. Claim 1 of the main request differs from D1 in that it specifically relates to composing an e‑mail message on a handheld device, attaching a remote file by sending an \"attachment instruction\" (rather than the file itself) to a mail agent, and having the mail agent retrieve the file from a file‑delivery server using supplied credentials.\n3. The skilled person, starting from D1, would be aware that mobile devices already support e‑mail composition and that e‑mail standards (e.g., MIME) allow the inclusion of remote file references. It would also be common general knowledge that, to save bandwidth on low‑speed mobile links, it is advantageous to transmit only a reference to a remote file together with the necessary access credentials, letting the mail server fetch the file.\n4. Combining D1’s remote‑file‑browsing functionality with the well‑known practice of e‑mail composition on handheld devices and the routine use of attachment instructions (or links) in e‑mail, the skilled person would arrive at the claimed method without any inventive contribution. The only technical features added (prompting for credentials, furnishing them to the browsing service, presenting the file list, and sending an attachment instruction) are straightforward implementations of known concepts.\n5. Consequently, the differences between the claim and D1 are either disclosed directly by D1 (remote file browsing, credential handling) or would have been obvious to the skilled person in view of common general knowledge about e‑mail on mobile devices. The claimed invention therefore lacks an inventive step under Article 56 EPC.\n\nConclusion: The claimed invention does **not** satisfy the requirement of an inventive step.",

{
  "reasoning": "1. **Identify the closest prior art** – The Board and the examining division agreed that D1 (US‑A‑5,418,222) is the closest document. D1 discloses the preparation of collagen (protein) films, their partial drying, formation of a cohesive body and compression to obtain a protein matrix material for wound‑healing applications.\n\n2. **Compare the claimed features with D1** –\n   - Claim 2 (method) requires steps (a)‑(e). D1 already teaches: (a) preparing a protein‑solvent composition, (b) casting/coating a film, (c) partially drying the film to a solvent content within the range 10‑30 % (the patent mentions 20‑80 % but D1 teaches that the solvent can be reduced to 10‑30 % by drying), (d) handling the dried film as a non‑brittle cohesive body, and (e) compressing the body at a pressure sufficient to reduce bulk solvent. The pressure range in D1 is not limited, but the skilled person would understand that pressures in the range 100 psi‑100 000 psi (689‑689 500 kPa) are routinely used for protein film compression.\n   - Claim 1 (product) adds a final solvent content of 10‑60 % (main request) or 30‑50 % (first auxiliary request). D1 teaches that the final solvent content can be adjusted by the amount of drying and compression; the range 10‑30 % is explicitly disclosed, and the broader range up to 60 % is a straightforward extrapolation.\n\n3. **Determine the technical effect** – The appellant relies on a declaration (Dr Masters) claiming higher tensile strength and delayed degradation. The Board’s communication (Sept 2015) stated that the comparative data do not convincingly demonstrate such an effect over D1. No reliable, reproducible improvement is on the record.\n\n4. **Formulate the objective technical problem** – Because no credible advantage is proved, the problem is merely to provide an alternative way of producing a solvated compressed protein matrix material, i.e. to obtain a product having the same functional purpose as D1 but using slightly different parameter ranges.\n\n5. **Assess obviousness** – A person skilled in the art, starting from D1, would:\n   - Recognise that the solvent content after drying can be varied within a wide interval (10‑30 % disclosed, up to 80 % is within routine experimental variation);\n   - Understand that compression pressures commonly employed in the field span 100 psi‑100 000 psi, so selecting any value within that interval is routine;\n   - Adjust the drying‑compression parameters to obtain a final solvent content of 30‑50 % (or 10‑60 %).\n   Hence the claimed modifications are routine optimisation steps that would be obvious to the skilled person.\n\n6. **Conclusion** – The claimed method and product do not involve an inventive contribution beyond D1. The lack of a demonstrated technical effect and the obviousness of the parameter ranges mean that the requirement of inventive step (Article 56 EPC) is not fulfilled.\n\nTherefore, the invention does **not** satisfy the inventive‑step requirement.",

  "reasoning": "1. The claimed method concerns processing simultaneous touch inputs on a web page, mapping each touch region to a distinct DOM node, determining separate touch events, combining them into a gesture event and sending that gesture to the web page.\n2. The closest prior art is D12 (\"An Architecture for Ink Annotations on Web Documents\"). D12 discloses capturing pen‑based ink input, linking the ink data with underlying document elements (DOM nodes) and using the DOM event model to process those inputs.\n3. D2 (DOM Level 2 Events Specification) teaches that events associated with DOM nodes can be captured, combined and dispatched to a web page. It therefore provides the technical means for detecting a gesture by combining separate events.\n4. D1 (US‑A‑2005/0162402) and D10/D11 disclose handling of touch input signals and event listeners in Java, i.e. how simultaneous touch signals can be received and interpreted as separate touch events.\n5. A skilled person, starting from D12, would recognise that the ink‑capture architecture could be implemented with a touch‑sensitive device instead of a pen, because touch devices were common general knowledge at the priority date. Using the DOM event model (D2) the skilled person would know how to map each touch region to a DOM node and how to combine the resulting touch‑start, touch‑move and touch‑end events into a higher‑level gesture event.\n6. Combining D12 (linking input to DOM nodes) with D2 (event handling) and the teaching of D1/D10 that simultaneous touch signals can be received and processed yields all the features of claim 1: simultaneous touch signals, association with different DOM nodes, determination of separate touch events, combination into a gesture, and dispatch to the web page.\n7. The differences between the claim and D12 (use of touch instead of pen, explicit mention of \"simultaneous\" signals) are routine adaptations that would be obvious to a skilled person familiar with touch‑screen technology and the DOM event model.\n8. Consequently, the claimed subject‑matter lacks an inventive step under Article 56 EPC.\n\nConclusion: The invention does not involve an inventive step.",

  "reasoning": "1. Identify the closest prior art. The examining division and the appeal file refer to document D1 (US‑B‑6 576 648) as the closest prior art. D1 discloses the compound anamorelin in an amorphous form and a step (j of example 1) that yields that amorphous material.\n2. Determine the distinguishing features of the claims over D1. The granted claims define:\n   - a specific crystalline form of the compound (claim 1),\n   - particular hydrate states, especially a dihydrate (claims 2‑4),\n   - a defined X‑ray powder diffraction pattern (claim 5),\n   - a process for preparing the crystalline form using methanol/water mixtures, defined temperature ranges and cooling steps (claims 6‑13).\n   D1 does not disclose any of these specific crystalline forms, hydrates, diffraction pattern or the detailed recrystallisation process.\n3. Assess the technical effect. Although the case file does not explicitly state the advantages, the description (amended pages) presumably links the crystalline form and the dihydrate to improved stability, solubility or pharmaceutical performance, which are recognised technical effects of a new polymorph.\n4. Evaluate obviousness. The examining division argued that recrystallising the amorphous material would be obvious. However, EPO case law requires that the skilled person would only be motivated to perform a specific recrystallisation when there is a recognised problem or a teaching directing to the particular solvent system, temperature range and hydrate form. The prior art (D1) merely teaches the amorphous material; it does not suggest using methanol/water, the defined temperature window, or targeting a dihydrate. The selection of these parameters and the identification of a new X‑ray pattern constitute a non‑routine optimisation rather than a routine step. Consequently, the skilled person would not have arrived at the claimed crystalline form in an obvious manner.\n5. Board’s decision. The appeal proceedings conclude with the statement: \"As the appellant's main request is granted, there was no need to hold oral proceedings.\" This indicates that the Board found the claims to meet all EPC requirements, including inventive step.\n6. Conclusion. Based on the distinguishing features, the lack of a direct teaching in D1 to obtain the claimed crystalline form, and the Board’s final grant, the claimed invention satisfies the requirement of an inventive step.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",

  "reasoning": "Step 1 – Identify the closest prior art. The Board and the appellant agree that the closest prior art is the Grafton® DBM Crunch product (document 19), which is a blend of demineralised bone fibres and cortical bone chips and does not contain any covering.\n\nStep 2 – Determine the distinguishing features of claim 1 over the closest prior art. The claim adds (i) a tubular covering made of a poly(glycolic acid) (PGA) mesh, (ii) a physical attachment mechanism (wrap, suture, wire, etc.), and (iii) the functional features that the covering retains the DBM substance and facilitates its transfer on implantation.\n\nStep 3 – Ascertain the technical problem. The appellant frames the problem as providing a DBM product with improved handling/delivery and a performance advantage over Grafton® DBM Crunch.\n\nStep 4 – Assess whether the solution would have been obvious to the skilled person. Documents (2) EP‑A‑82621, (7) US‑A‑2004/220615 and (17) WO 2008/013763 disclose porous mesh coverings for bone‑related implants. The use of a PGA mesh and the various attachment means are well‑known in the art of surgical delivery systems. Combining a known mesh covering with a known DBM product to obtain a tubular delivery system is a routine design step that a skilled person seeking to improve handling would consider. The appellant’s argument that a mesh would act as a barrier and therefore be counter‑intuitive is contradicted by the teaching of the cited mesh‑covering documents, which expressly describe porous meshes that allow tissue ingrowth and material transfer. Hence, the combination does not involve a technical teaching that goes beyond the ordinary knowledge of a person skilled in the art.\n\nStep 5 – Consider the alleged unexpected technical effect. The appellant relies on a declaration (Dr D Shimko) showing a performance improvement of the Magnifuse® DBM system over Grafton® DBM Crunch. The declaration is not reproduced in the case file, and no quantitative data or explanation of the effect is provided. Under the EPC, an unexpected technical effect must be clearly and convincingly demonstrated. In the absence of concrete data, the Board would treat the alleged improvement as insufficient to establish an inventive step.\n\nStep 6 – Apply the problem‑solution approach. The objective technical problem (improved handling/delivery) is solved by adding a known mesh covering with known attachment means. Because the solution is directly derivable from the teachings of documents (2), (7) and (17), and because the alleged advantage is not convincingly proven, the solution is considered obvious.\n\nConclusion – The subject‑matter of claim 1 does not involve an inventive step over the closest prior art combined with the teaching of the mesh‑covering documents.\n\nAnswer: No",

  "reasoning": "1. **Identify the closest prior art**: The Examining Division and the Board considered D1 (logical bill‑of‑material for make‑to‑order) together with D3 (product modelling using STEP) as the closest prior art. Both were published before the filing date of the patent application and therefore are relevant for the inventive‑step analysis.\n\n2. **Determine the distinguishing features of claim 1** (main request):\n   - The claim is directed to a method performed in a CAD/CAM environment.\n   - The product data‑model comprises a *parent assembly* and *children*, a set of *component‑usages* linked to the parent assembly, and a set of *logical component‑usages* linked to the component‑usages, all hierarchically interconnected.\n   - The claim further includes the use of the logical component‑usages for selecting component‑usages and for identifying the role of component‑usages in an assembly configuration (features recited in dependent claims 2‑5).\n   - Claims 6‑10 add technical steps such as constructing occurrence nodes, logical occurrence nodes, mapping CAD designs and manufacturing sequences, and an effectivity/applicability scheme.\n\n3. **Technical effect of the distinguishing features**: The appellant argues that the introduction of a \"logical component‑usage\" as an abstraction of a component‑usage reduces duplication of engineering data, improves consistency checking, and enables a single product data‑model to serve both design and manufacturing domains.\n\n4. **Obviousness assessment**:\n   - **D1** discloses a logical representation of parent‑product variants and component‑product variants using compatibility matrices. It teaches the idea of a logical relationship between components but does not disclose the hierarchical structure of *component‑usages* and *logical component‑usages* as defined in the claim, nor does it teach their use in a CAD/CAM workflow.\n   - **D3** teaches the use of STEP for product data modelling, including hierarchical assemblies and the storage of product data in a computer‑readable format. It does not disclose the notion of \"logical component‑usage\" or the effectivity scheme for selecting component‑usages.\n   - A skilled person faced with D1 would recognise the need for a logical representation of component relationships. Looking at D3, the skilled person would know how to implement hierarchical product data‑models in a CAD environment. Combining the two teachings, it would be routine to model the logical relationships of D1 as separate objects (logical component‑usages) linked to the component‑usage objects of D3, because both documents already deal with hierarchical product structures and logical relationships. The additional steps of constructing occurrence nodes and mapping CAD/CAM data are standard modelling operations in STEP‑based systems and would be obvious to a person skilled in CAD/CAM data integration.\n   - The Board’s provisional opinion and the Examining Division’s decision both concluded that the combination of D1 and D3 renders the subject‑matter obvious. No evidence was presented that the specific hierarchical interconnection of logical component‑usages, or the particular effectivity scheme, produced a technical contribution beyond what the skilled person would obtain by straightforward combination of the teachings.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The claimed subject‑matter lacks an inventive step because the distinguishing features are either disclosed directly (hierarchical product model) or would have been obvious to combine (logical component‑usage abstraction) for a person skilled in the art in view of D1 and D3. The appellant did not provide any new arguments or evidence (e.g., a declaration) and did not attend the oral proceedings, so the Board is likely to confirm the lack of inventive step.\n\n**Final answer**: No, the claimed invention does not satisfy the requirement of an inventive step.",

  "reasoning": "1. Identify the closest prior art. The examining division and the board both treat document D1 (US 2005/0262338 A) as the closest prior art because it discloses a lottery ticket with a unique validation code, a two‑key scheme (first key to create an authentication code printed on the ticket, second key stored at a central server) and a verification step across a network.\\n\\n2. Compare the features of claim 1 with D1.\\n   - Providing tickets with a unique validation code – disclosed in D1.\\n   - Generating a first encryption code from the validation code – analogous to D1’s generation of an authentication code from the first key.\\n   - Storing the first encryption code at the lottery provider – D1 stores the second key at a server, which serves a similar purpose of keeping a secret value that can be used for later verification.\\n   - Allowing players to submit validation codes and applying the same algorithm to obtain a second encryption code – D1 does not describe a second‑chance game, but it does describe a verification step where the server uses the stored second key to check the submitted code.\\n   - Comparing the two codes and, upon a match, registering the ticket for a second‑chance drawing – the comparison step is directly taught by D1 (verification of authenticity) and by D2/D4 (hash/password comparison). The additional administrative step of entering the ticket into a second‑chance record is a routine business‑logic addition that does not involve a technical contribution.\\n\\n3. Identify additional teachings that would fill the remaining gaps. Document D2 (US 2006/0059363 A) teaches the generation of a hash (or encrypted) value for data, storing the hash, and later recomputing the hash on submitted data and comparing the two values. This teaching directly maps onto the \"first encryption code\"/\"second encryption code\" and the match‑checking steps of claim 1.\\n\\n4. Combine D1 with D2 (or with D4, which teaches the same password‑hash comparison). A skilled person confronted with D1 would recognise that the authentication mechanism is essentially a hash‑like comparison. To extend the system to a second‑chance game, the skilled person would simply store the hash of the validation code (first encryption code) at the provider, and when a player submits a validation code, recompute the hash (second encryption code) and compare – exactly the method of claim 1. No teaching is required to link the result of the match to a \"second‑chance\" record; that is a straightforward business‑rule addition.\\n\\n5. Assess the problem‑solution approach.\\n   - Objective technical problem: provide a secure way for a player to enter a validation code online and be entered into a subsequent game without exposing the plain‑text validation code.\\n   - Solution: the method of claim 1.\\n   - Obviousness: The combination of D1 (ticket authentication) with the generic hash‑comparison teaching of D2/D4 would lead the skilled person to the claimed solution in an obvious manner. The board’s provisional opinion explicitly states that the invention lacks inventive step in view of a \"notorious lottery game\" and D4, confirming that the solution is routine for someone skilled in the art.\\n\\n6. Conclusion. The claimed method does not involve a technical contribution beyond the straightforward application of known cryptographic hash/comparison techniques to a lottery context. Consequently, the invention lacks an inventive step under Article 56 EPC.\n\nAnswer: No",

It does **not** disclose: a log‑structured file system, two separate layout formats tied to the LSFS, the specific migration steps involving a log, the notion of regions with contiguous block‑number ranges, nor the explicit “write‑anywhere” vs “sequential‑write” techniques.  \n4. **Assess obviousness of the distinguishing features** – While a skilled person would recognise that hybrid SSD/HDD systems are known, the combination of a LSFS that simultaneously manages two different layout formats, the region‑based placement on HDDs, and the specific migration procedure (identifying related data, copying into the LSFS log, then storing in contiguous regions) is not taught or suggested by the prior art.  The prior art merely mentions generic copying and caching; it provides no teaching that a LSFS should be used to implement distinct layouts or that migration should be performed via a log and region‑based storage.  Moreover, the “write‑anywhere” technique for SSDs and the “sequential‑write” technique for HDDs are technical solutions aimed at exploiting the intrinsic characteristics of each medium, which the prior art does not disclose.  Consequently, a person skilled in the art would not arrive at the claimed combination in an obvious manner.  \n5. **Conclusion** – The claimed subject‑matter contains technical features that go beyond the teaching of the closest prior art and are not obvious to the skilled person. Therefore, the invention satisfies the requirement of an inventive step under Article 56 EPC.\n\n**Answer**: Yes",

  "reasoning": "1. Identify the closest prior art. The examining division and the board focused on D2 (enhanced symbol‑mapping based on bit priority) together with D7 (3GPP TS 25.212, which describes the standard turbo‑coding, rate‑matching and interleaving procedures used in UMTS/LTE).\n\n2. Determine the distinguishing features of claim 1. The claim requires:\n   - Separate interleavers for systematic bits and parity bits;\n   - Each interleaver writes the bits row‑by‑row from the first to the last row;\n   - A subsequent inter‑column permutation performed according to a determined rule;\n   - The modulator collects the permuted bits column‑by‑column alternately from the two interleavers;\n   - If the systematic bits exceed the capacity of the first interleaver, the excess bits are written into the second interleaver;\n   - The two interleavers have the same size.\n\n3. Compare with D7. TS 25.212 already discloses a turbo encoder, a rate‑matcher and a sub‑block interleaver that arranges bits in a matrix, writes them row‑wise and then performs a column‑wise permutation. The standard treats systematic and parity bits together, but the skilled person knows that systematic and parity streams can be handled separately (e.g., separate buffers) without departing from the teaching of the specification. The idea of using two identical buffers (interleavers) of the same size is a straightforward implementation choice.\n\n4. Compare with D2. D2 adds the concept of \"bit priority\" for symbol mapping. It teaches that bits of different priority (often systematic bits) may be mapped before parity bits. This teaching makes it obvious to a skilled person to allocate overflow systematic bits to the parity‑bit buffer when the systematic buffer is full – a routine solution to the capacity problem.\n\n5. Problem‑solution approach. The technical problem can be formulated as \"providing a way to map systematic and parity bits to modulation symbols while handling the case where the number of systematic bits exceeds the capacity of the dedicated buffer\". The solution – using two identical interleavers, writing rows first, applying a column permutation and, in case of overflow, writing the excess systematic bits into the second interleaver – is directly suggested by the combination of D7 (row‑wise write + column permutation) and D2 (priority‑based mapping and the need to deal with excess bits). No teaching in the prior art requires a non‑obvious technical contribution beyond routine optimisation.\n\n6. The board’s preliminary opinion explicitly raised an objection under Art 56 EPC in view of D2 and D7, indicating that the Board considered the claimed features to be obvious. No later argument or amendment overcame this objection, and the decision was announced after oral proceedings without a reversal of the inventive‑step objection.\n\n7. Conclusion. The claimed subject‑matter does not involve an inventive step because the distinguishing features are either disclosed in the prior art or would have been obvious to the skilled person combining D2 and D7.\n\nAnswer: No.",

  "reasoning": "1. **Identify the closest prior art** – The case data point to document D5 as the closest prior art. D5 discloses a system with a LED driver module and a current controller module that generates a temperature‑dependent feedback signal based on sensed temperature and LED current, and mixes these signals to produce a feedback voltage (UREG). The description of D5 (\"Closest prior art\" section) explicitly mentions means for generating a temperature feedback signal, means for generating a current feedback signal (as a voltage), and means for mixing them via an adder and an operational‑amplifier regulator.\n\n2. **Compare claim features with D5** – Claim 1 requires:\n   - (i) a means for generating a temperature feedback signal **as a temperature feedback voltage** produced by a **first operational amplifier**;\n   - (ii) a means for generating a current feedback signal **as a current feedback voltage** produced by a **second operational amplifier**;\n   - (iii) means for mixing the two voltages to obtain a feedback voltage.\n   D5 already discloses the functional equivalents of (i)–(iii). While the Board in T 1983/09 held that D5 was silent about the *type* of signal and the *adder*, the factual description of D5 in the present case states that the temperature feedback is derived from an NTC sensor and fed to an operational‑amplifier regulator, and that the current feedback is the output of an integrator (a voltage) also fed to the same regulator. The mixing is performed by an adder at the regulator’s input. Thus, the structural features of (i)–(iii) are either directly disclosed or can be interpreted as being disclosed in D5.\n\n3. **Determine the objective technical problem** – The appellant formulates the problem as providing a \"more simplified responsive feedback control\" that yields continuous current control over a wide temperature range. This problem is a straightforward improvement of the system already taught by D5.\n\n4. **Assess whether the solution is obvious** – The skilled person, starting from D5, would recognise that the temperature and current feedback signals are already voltages and that they are summed by an adder before being applied to the regulator. Using operational amplifiers to generate these voltages is common general knowledge in analog circuit design. Document D6 (cited by the Examining Division) explicitly teaches that operational amplifiers are normally employed for processing measured signals in LED driver circuits. Consequently, replacing the generic “means for generating … voltage” with explicit first and second operational amplifiers would be an obvious design choice. No teaching or hint in D5 or D6 suggests a non‑obvious technical effect beyond what is already achieved by the prior art; the alleged advantage of \"continuous control over a wide temperature range\" is already inherent in D5’s description of temperature‑dependent current reduction.\n\n5. **Apply the problem‑solution approach** – \n   - *Closest prior art*: D5 (discloses all functional features). \n   - *Objective technical problem*: Provide a simplified implementation of the feedback control. \n   - *Obviousness*: The modification (explicit use of two operational amplifiers) is directly suggested by the common knowledge of using op‑amps for signal conditioning (as reflected in D6). Hence the skilled person would arrive at the claimed arrangement without inventive activity.\n\n6. **Conclusion** – The claimed subject‑matter lacks an inventive step because the distinguishing features are either already disclosed in D5 or would have been obvious to the skilled person in view of D5 together with the common general knowledge (including D6). Therefore, the invention does not meet the EPC requirement of inventive step.\n\n**Final answer**: No.",

Use the provided CASE DATA strictly. Do not use outside knowledge but you can use your own interpretations of the given facts to reason.
Determine whether the patent fulfils the inventive step criteria or not.=== CASE DATA ===
--- APPEAL FACTS ---
I. The applicant (appellant) filed an appeal against the decision of the Examining Division posted on 8 August 2008 refusing European patent application No. 03076109.2.

II. The decision made reference to the following documents:

D1: Wongvasu N. et al.: "Representing the relationship between items in logical bill-of-material to support customers' requests for quotation for make-to-order products", Proceedings of SPIE, Vol. 4192, p. 74-85 (2000); and

D3: Gu P. et al.: "Product modelling using STEP", Computer-Aided Design, Vol. 27, No. 3, p. 163-179, (March 1995).

The Examining Division decided that the main request contravened Article 123(2) EPC, that claim 1 of the first auxiliary request lacked an inventive step over a combination of documents D1 and D3, but also without reference to a document, and that the second auxiliary request again contravened Article 123(2) EPC.

III. With the statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant filed a copy of the post-published document

D4: Callahan S.: "Extended Generic Product Structure: An Information Model for Representing Product Families", Journal of Computing and Information Science in Engineering, Vol. 6, p. 263-275 (September 2006).

The appellant further indicated that a declaration by an expert in the field was expected to be filed soon. No such declaration has been submitted.

The appellant requested that the decision be set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of a main request or, in the alternative, on the basis of a first or a second auxiliary request. According to the statement of grounds of appeal, the main request corresponded to the first auxiliary request as filed in the first-instance proceedings and the first auxiliary request corresponded to the second auxiliary request as filed in the first-instance proceedings.

IV. The claims of the main request, the first auxiliary request ("auxiliary request I") and the second auxiliary request ("auxiliary request II") were filed on 22 December 2008 together with the "confirmation copy" of the statement of grounds of appeal, i.e. after expiry of the time limit for the statement of grounds of appeal. The claims of the main request corresponded to those of the first auxiliary request before the department of first instance. Claim 1 of auxiliary request I corresponded to claim 1 of the second auxiliary request before the department of first instance. The dependent claims of auxiliary request I differed from those of the second auxiliary request before the department of first instance.

V. The Board appointed oral proceedings. In a communication accompanying the summons to oral proceedings, the Board provisionally expressed a negative opinion on all requests. Among other objections, claim 1 of both the main request and auxiliary request I appeared to lack an inventive step. Questions were raised regarding the admissibility of auxiliary request II.

VI. With a letter dated 11 February 2014, the appellant informed the Board that it would not appear at the oral proceedings. The letter did not address any of the issues raised in the communication accompanying the summons.

VII. The oral proceedings were held on 10 March 2014 in the absence of the appellant. At the end of the oral proceedings the chairman announced the decision of the Board.

VIII. Claim 1 of the main request reads as follows:

"A method of designing products using CAD and of manufacturing products using CAM, wherein a product data-model is stored in a memory associated with a computer, said product data-model representing product information about at least one component that is a constituent of at least one parent assembly, comprising:

a parent assembly and two or more children, each comprising at least one component, said parent assembly holding information for associating the two children with the parent assembly;

a plurality of component-usages for holding information relating to usages of the component, said component-usages being operatively connected to a component of the parent assembly;

a plurality of logical component-usages for holding information relating to logical usages of the component, said logical component-usages being operatively connected to said component-usages; and

said parent assembly, said component-usages and said logical component-usages being hierarchically interconnected."

IX. Claim 1 of auxiliary request I reads as follows:

"A method of designing products using CAD and of manufacturing products using CAM, wherein a product data-model is stored in a memory associated with a computer, said product data-model representing product information about at least one component that is a constituent of at least one parent assembly, said data model comprising a parent assembly and two or more children, said parent assembly holding information for associating the two children with the parent assembly, said method comprising:

selecting one component-usage to be included in a product configuration from a plurality of component-usages in said data model and for holding information relating to usages of the component;

selecting one from the component-usages connected to it from a plurality of logical component-usages of said data model and for holding information relating to logical usages of the component, said logical component-usages being operatively connected to said component-usages; wherein said logical component-usages are used to identify the existence of a role for said component-usages in an assembly configuration represented by a general motional [sic] mechanism for expressing to which particular configuration each logical component-usage and component-usage is applicable, the logical component usages are labeled with applicability attributes (O1, O2) that determine whether they apply to a given product configuration, including option attributes (O1, O2) of which the options are mutually exclusive."

X. Claim 1 of auxiliary request II reads as follows:

"A method for representing assembly configurations using a generalized occurrence structure stored in a memory, comprising:

(a) constructing a plurality of occurrence nodes corresponding to paths in a representation of a product data-model comprising hierarchically interconnected parent assembly, a plurality of component-usages, and a plurality of logical component-usages;

(b) constructing a plurality of logical occurrence nodes associated with a plurality of said occurrence nodes;

(c) storing product data in said occurrence nodes;

(d) associating a plurality of part-interfaces with said occurrence nodes;

(e) associating a plurality of part usages with a plurality of logical occurrence nodes depending upon logical relationships between said part-usages; and

(f) forming a mapping of a plurality of computer-aided designs of said parts with said product data-model

wherein said step (a) further comprises

forming a mapping of at least one manufacturing assembly sequence to at least one computer-aided-design that is stored in said product data model, said manufacturing assembly sequence comprising a plurality of manufacturing assemblies which include a plurality of components and a plurality of assemblies, wherein it is ensured by an effectivity or applicability scheme that for any one valid assembly configuration of the parent assembly 12 using the logical component usage node 18, there is only one component usage node 14, the logical component usage node 18 determining which one of the multiple (if any) component usage nodes 14 associated with it becomes part of a given valid assembly configuration of the parent assembly 12."

XI. In support of inventive step, the appellant essentially argued as follows:

The data models described in the claims were used in the technical field of computer-aided design systems and computer-aided manufacturing environments. In this technical field virtual product modelling could expedite a design process for a family of products sharing an overall product architecture. The designer could customise the product selected from a product family that included many product variants.

Before the present invention, a designer reconstructed relationships between product design domains, either mentally or with some minimal computer support. Manual tracking of such relationships incurred high costs and was prone to errors. Reduced use of effectivity, viz. defining which part went into each end product configuration, meant diminishing knowledge of what was common among different product designs.

The invention avoided the undesirable situation where there were many copies of engineering bill-of-material assembly definitions that were similar but had unique copies of product structure definitions. In addition, multiple and independent drawings, CAD data and product structures for variance were eliminated.

The "logical component usage" concept was used to check the consistency of the selection of component usages and was a mechanism to help designers understand which component usages were alternative to each other, versus which component usages fulfilled different purposes in the design.

The present invention introduced logical component usage as an abstraction of component usage. In the prior art a component usage was considered to be a relationship object. It was counter-intuitive to consider abstracting a relationship.

The invention introduced the idea of considering a component usage as a lightweight copy of a component instead of as a relationship. This allowed component usage to be abstracted, since it had become a virtual thing instead of a relationship. This concept of a lightweight copy was further introduced in document D4.

TITLE: Representing the relationship between items in logical
bill-of-material to support customers’ request for quotation for
make-to-order products

TYPE: Academic Paper

ABSTRACT: 

For make-to-order products in which the specification of some component-product variants are to be defined by
customers, it is almost impossible to develop a bill-of-material system that support customers’ requests for quotation
(RFQ) response activities usingthe existingbill-of-material concepts. To deal with this problem, a new technique
for representingthe relationship between parent-product variants and component-product variants in the generic
bill-of-material (GBOM) structure is developed. The new technique is based on an assumption that the relationship
between any two components in a product structure has pairwise independent property. The technique represents the
relationship with compatibility constraints in the form of matrices and rules. The new representation provides users
with a means to describingvariants of make-to-order products as well as supportingthe customers’ RFQ response
activities with only a limited amount of data which is comprehensive, easy to maintain, and easy to understand.

--- APPEAL FACTS ---
I. This appeal ("second appeal") is against the decision of the examining division ("second decision"), posted on 30 November 2010, to refuse European patent application No. 02028629.0 on the grounds that the prior art was not properly acknowledged (Rule 27(1)(b) EPC 1973), that the two-part form was not properly provided (Rule 29(1)(a)(b) EPC 1973), and that the subject-matter of the application lacked an inventive step (Article 56 EPC) with respect to a main request, a first auxiliary request, and a second auxiliary request, having regard to the disclosure of

D2: "Enhanced Symbol Mapping method for the

modulation of Turbo-coded bits based on bit

and the skilled person's common general knowledge as evidenced by

D7: "TS 25.212 V1.0.0", 3GPP TSG RAN WG1,

Multiplexing and channel coding (FDD), pp. 1-38,

April 1999.

A previous appeal ("first appeal") against the former decision of the examining division ("first decision"), posted on 16 February 2009, to refuse the present patent application on the grounds that the prior art was not properly acknowledged (Rule 42(1)(b) EPC), that the two-part form was not properly provided (Rule 43(1) EPC), and that the claims lacked clarity (Article 84 EPC) with respect to a sole request was settled by a decision, taken by this board in an entirely different composition ("the former board"), ordering that the first decision be set aside, that the case be remitted to the examining division for further prosecution, and that the appeal fee be reimbursed following a substantial procedural violation committed by the examining division (cf. T 1123/09). As to the reasoning of that decision, the former board held inter alia that the appellant had the right to amend the description to acknowledge the respective prior-art documents following the objection raised by the examining division under Rule 27(1)(b) EPC 1973 (cf. point 3), that the formulation of the pending independent claims in the two-part form had to be postponed (cf. point 4), that the objected claims were clear (cf. point 6), and that the examining division had committed a substantial procedural violation in using new and unsupported principles with regard to the application of

Rule 27(1)(b) EPC 1973 (Rule 42(1)(b) EPC) in that case (cf. point 8).

II. Notice of appeal was received on 10 February 2011. The appeal fee was paid on the same day. With the statement setting out the grounds of appeal, received on 8 April 2011, the appellant filed new claims according to a main request, a first auxiliary request, and a second auxiliary request. It requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of the main request or any of the auxiliary requests. In addition, oral proceedings were requested as an auxiliary measure.

III. A summons to oral proceedings scheduled for 1 October 2013 was issued on 11 July 2013. In an annex to this summons, the board expressed its preliminary opinion on the appeal pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA. In particular, objections were raised by the board under Articles 123(2) and 56 EPC, in view of D2 and D7.

IV. With a letter of reply dated 30 August 2013, the appellant filed amended claims according to a main request and an auxiliary request. It also submitted arguments as to why D7 did not disclose the established distinguishing features and advised that a "more detailed explanation" would be provided during the oral proceedings.

V. Oral proceedings were held as scheduled on 1 October 2013, during which the former main and auxiliary requests were replaced by a new main request (claims 1 to 8) as a sole request in response to objections raised by the board under Articles 123(2) and 56 EPC. The main request was admitted into the appeal proceedings and its patentability was discussed.

The appellant's final request was that the decision under appeal be set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of the main request as filed during the oral proceedings before the board. At the end of the oral proceedings, the board announced its decision.

VI. Claim 1 of the main request reads as follows:

"An apparatus for data transmission in a communication system, comprising:

a turbo encoder (220) for turbo coding data bits to generate systematic bits and parity bits;

a rate matcher (230) for rate matching the systematic bits and parity bits;

a first and second interleaver (250, 260) for separately writing the rate-matched systematic bits and the rate-matched parity bits; and

a modulator (280) for alternately mapping bits collected from the first interleaver and the second interleaver onto one modulation symbol according to a modulation scheme,

characterized in that

the first interleaver is arranged for writing the rate-matched systematic bits row by row from a first row to a last row, and the second interleaver is arranged for writing the rate-matched parity bits row by row from a first row to a last row, wherein the first and second interleavers are arranged for then separately interleaving the systematic bits and the parity bits by performing inter-column permutation, respectively, according to a determined rule,

wherein the modulator is arranged for alternately collecting the permutated bits column by column in the first interleaver and the second interleaver, and

wherein in case that a number of the rate-matched systematic bits is too large for them to be written into the first interleaver, the excessive number of rate-matched systematic bits is written in the second interleaver."

The further independent claim 4 of the main request is directed to a corresponding method, while independent claims 7 and 8 are directed to a complementary apparatus and method, respectively.

TITLE: Adaptive HARQ for fixed TTI using soft acknowledgement

TYPE: Working Group Document

DOCUMENT:

We showed a physical layer structure and coding scheme that combines the advantages of the conventional fixed 
and variable TTI proposals by allowing to use two parallel data streams for each TTI. The main benefits are: 
• flexible mapping of required retransmission energy using MCS level and code rate adaptation, as 
well as bit mapping, 
• reduced interference, 
• allows soft-combining of retransmissions at different MCS levels,
• high frame fill efficiency, 
• increased throughput, 
• maintains simplicity of fixed TTI. 
The concepts presented in this paper are suitable for incremental redundancy, but can also be adapted to Chase 
combining.

--- APPEAL FACTS ---
I. The appeal is against the decision of the examining division, posted on 11 February 2011, to refuse European patent application No. 09159981.1 on the ground of lack of inventive step (Article 56 EPC) with respect to the independent claims of a main request and an auxiliary request, having regard to the disclosure of

D1: Y.C. Lai et al.: "Design and implementation of

a wireless internet remote access platform",

Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,

Vol. 6, pp. 413-429, 9 January 2006.

II. Notice of appeal was received on 7 April 2011. The appeal fee was paid on the same day. With the statement setting out the grounds of appeal, received on 11 May 2011, the appellant re-filed the claims of the main and the auxiliary requests underlying the appealed decision. It requested that the decision of the examining division be set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of the main request or the auxiliary request.

III. A summons to oral proceedings scheduled for 7 August 2014 was issued on 12 May 2014. In an annex to this summons, the board gave its preliminary opinion on the appeal pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA. In particular, objections were raised under Article 56 EPC in view of D1 and the skilled person's common general knowledge.

IV. With a letter of reply dated 7 July 2014, the appellant submitted amended claims according to a new main request and a first auxiliary request. It also re-filed the claims of the previous auxiliary request as a second auxiliary request and provided counter-arguments with regard to the objections raised in the board's communication under Article 15(1) RPBA.

V. Following a request of the appellant, a telephone conversation was held between the appellant's representative and the rapporteur of this case during which the representative was informed that, according to the preliminary opinion of the board, the objections under Article 56 EPC were maintained.

VI. By letter of reply dated 5 August 2014, the appellant informed the board that it would not be attending the scheduled oral proceedings and requested that the appeal be allowed based on the pending requests filed on 7 July 2014. It also submitted that the claims of those requests had been "further distinguished over D1 to provide an inventive step" and had "placed the application in a condition ready for grant".

VII. Oral proceedings were held as scheduled on 7 August 2014 in the absence of the appellant. The board established from the file that the appellant's final request was that the decision under appeal be set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of one of the main request, the first auxiliary request and the second auxiliary request, all requests as filed with letter dated 7 July 2014.

After due deliberation on the basis of the pending requests and the written submissions, the board announced its decision at the end of the oral proceedings.

VIII. Claim 1 of the main request reads as follows:

"A method in a wireless hand-held device of composing an e-mail message that will include a remote file attachment, comprising:

receiving a user instruction to attach a file (410) to an e-mail message for at least one recipient;

in response to receiving the user instruction, requesting a file browsing service on a file delivery server via a network to obtain a list of files in a directory;

if file access credentials (418) are required to access the directory:

prompting for file access credentials (418)

needed to access the directory;

furnishing the file access credentials (428) to the file browsing service;

presenting the list of files using a user interface of the wireless hand-held device (422,424);

receiving another user instruction to send the e-mail message (428), along with a file from the list of files to attach to the e-mail message (426); and

TITLE: Design and implementation of a wireless internet remote access platform

TYPE: Academic Paper

ABSTRACT:

Recently, mobile networks and internet technologies have been widely developed for the voice communication and information retrieval services all over the world. Compared with the wire-line internet environment, mobile networks have lower bandwidth, longer transmission latency and unreliable connection, and the capability of mobile terminals is restricted by the limited memory size, lower CPU computation capability and inconvenient I/O interface. These limitations restrict the development of the wireless internet applications. In this paper, we design and implement a ‘wireless internet remote access platform’ (WIRAP). The WIRAP platform interconnects the wireless network and internet to provide mobile users a remote centralized storage and computation environment. A mobile user can store large volume of data and execute complex computations on WIRAP instead of on the mobile terminals. WIRAP supports different network interfaces (e.g. short message service (SMS), wireless markup language (WML) and hyper text markup language (HTML) and users may use terminals (with different network capabilities) to access WIRAP.

--- APPEAL FACTS ---
I. The appeal lies from the decision of the Examining Division refusing European patent application No. 08 873 572.5.

II. Inter alia the following documents were cited in the examination proceedings:

(2) EP-A-82621,

(7) US-A-2004/220615,

(17) WO 2008/013763 and

(19) http://www.orthosupersite.com/images/content/OT/200505/DBM.pdf (pdf dated May 2005).

III. In the decision under appeal, the Examining Division found that that the subject-matter of the then pending main request did not fulfil the requirements of Articles 123(2) and 56 EPC. More particularly, it found that claim 1 of said request found a basis in the application as filed, but not the late-filed drawings. With regard to inventive step, a demineralised bone matrix (DBM) of document (19) represented the closest prior art, the subject-matter of said claim not being inventive thereover in the light of documents (2), (7) and/or (17), which taught porous mesh coverings for bone implants.

IV. With letter dated 23 January 2017, the Appellant (Applicant) submitted a main request and auxiliary requests 1 to 3 and 4a to 4d and withdrew the request made before the Examining Division to insert figures 13a to 13g into the specification. During oral proceedings before the Board, held on 23 February 2017, it filed a new main request, replacing the previous main request.

V. The Appellant submitted that the subject-matter of all requests complied with the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC. By withdrawing the request to insert figures 13a to 13g into the specification, the objections in point 12 of the contested decision under Article 123(2) EPC were overcome. With regard to inventive step, the product Grafton® DBM Crunch of document (19) represented the closest prior art. The declaration of Dr. D. Shimko filed with letter dated 23 January 2017 containing further experimental data comparing a delivery system according to the invention, namely Magnifuse® DBM, with said product, showed a performance improvement for Magnifuse® DBM over Grafton® DBM Crunch. Said improvement was unexpected, since at the date of filing of the present application it would have been counter-intuitive and gone against accepted teachings in this field for the skilled person seeking to promote bone fusion at a grafting site, to provide the bone products with a mesh covering which would act as a barrier between the bone products and the bone, inter alia document (23) being cited in this respect:

(23) D. G. Marchesi: "Spinal fusions: bone and bone substitutes", Eur. Spine J., 2000, 9, pages 372 to 378.

The skilled person would not have turned to the teachings of documents (2), (7) and/or (17) when seeking to develop an improved bone void filler product to maximise bone tissue regeneration. The claimed subject-matter was thus inventive.

VI. The Appellant requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of the main request as filed during oral proceedings before the Board, or, subsidiarily, on the basis of any of the auxiliary requests 1 to 3 and 4a to 4d as filed with letter dated 23 January 2017.

VII. At the end of the oral proceedings, the decision of the Board was announced.

--- APPEAL FACTS ---
I. This is an appeal against the refusal of European patent application No. 07 841 130 for lack of inventive step (Article 56 EPC 1973).

II. The applicant requested in writing that the decision under appeal be set aside and a patent be granted on the basis of claims 1 to 11 filed with letter dated 27 October 2009, as sole request.

Oral proceedings were also requested.

III. Claim 1 of this request reads as follows:

"1. A method for implementing a second-chance game to or an end of game drawing for players of a lottery game, comprising the steps of:

providing tickets for the lottery game, wherein the tickets are each assigned a unique validation code;

applying an algorithm to generate a unique, first encryption code for each ticket validation code;

storing the first encryption code in a record at a lottery provider;

distributing the tickets for possession by players of the lottery game;

allowing players to submit the unique validation codes for registration into a lottery provider's database;

on the part of the lottery provider, applying the algorithm to the submitted validation codes to create a second encryption code for each submitted validation code;

on the part of the lottery provider, comparing the second encryption code with the record of first encryption codes to determine whether a match exists; and

on the part of the lottery provider, registering players for the second-chance game or for the end of game drawing when such players submit a validation code that results in a match."

Claims 2 to 11 are dependent on claim 1.

IV. The following documents are mentioned in this decision:

D1 = US 2005/0262338 A

D2 = US 2006/0059363 A

D4 = "The UNIX Programming Environment", Prentice-Hall Inc., 1984, pp. 52-53

V. The examining division essentially argued that:

- Document D1 disclosed a lottery game in which tickets with a unique validation code were provided and distributed to the players of the lottery game. The problem to be solved by the application could be formulated as providing an alternative cryptographic access and authentication scheme to the scheme suggested in D1. Document D2 disclosed the generation and storage of hashes which were compared to hashed submitted information. The skilled person starting from D1 would incorporate the cryptographic access and authentication scheme of D2 in an obvious manner into D1 for the purpose of solving the problem. The remaining features of the method of claim 1 were rules and schemes of playing games and did not contribute in the assessment of inventive step.

VI. The appellant argued in writing essentially as follows:

- The present invention provided a secure validation and authentication system, wherein the players could enter instant lottery tickets, such as scratch-off tickets, into a subsequent game. According to one exemplary form of the present invention, lottery tickets were printed with a unique validation code. Once the validation codes were generated, the numbers were converted into encrypted validation codes. Along with a record of the encrypted validation codes, the tickets were transferred to a lottery provider who stored the record of the encrypted validation codes. Finally, the lottery provider distributed the lottery tickets. By encrypting the unique validation codes, it could be assured that there would be no record of these unique validation codes being accessible to unauthorized persons. Only the encrypted validation codes (first encryption codes) were transferred to the lottery provider. Thus a secure and easily manageable system for conducting a second-chance game or an end of game drawing based on instant-win lottery tickets was provided, since only the validation code from a ticket in the first game had to be entered to participate in the second-chance game. The system generated a second encryption code from the entered validation code and compared it to the first encryption code that was generated for that particular validation code. If the first and second encryption codes matched, then the player was automatically entered into the second-chance game or end of game drawing, and was eligible for winning the game without having to actually present the lottery ticket for redemption.

- Document D1 was considered by the examining division to be the closest prior art. This document disclosed a rather complicated method for authenticating a ticket across a network, including a plurality of document-printing terminals. Document D2 related to a completely different field than the present invention and D1. D2 centered on the correct delivery of a computerized device to a specific end user. Thus, there was no reason why a skilled person would look into D2 to solve the problem of the invention. The flow of information from a lottery provider to ticket terminals and back to the lottery provider (as in D1), as well as the flow of information from the distributor of computerized devices to an end user (as in D2) were not compatible and a combination was certainly not obvious to the skilled person.

VII. In a communication pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA annexed to the summons to oral proceedings, the board informed the appellant of its provisional opinion that it shared his view that the combination of documents D1 and D2 did not lead to the invention, but that it nevertheless considered the invention to lack an inventive step having regard to a notorious lottery game and the disclosure of D4.

VIII. In reply to the objections raised by the board the appellant argued essentially that:

- Document D4 disclosed a broad teaching of the well-known UNIX system to store an encrypted record of passwords and, upon receipt of a password from a user, encrypting the received password and comparing such encryption to the record of stored encrypted passwords to determine validity of the received password. However, security of the validation record in the lottery industry was paramount and the flow of the validation numbers and validation records between the three involved entities: the lottery ticket manufacturer, the lottery provider, and the lottery player, were critical. The interplay between these entities was a relevant feature of the invention which had no relation to the UNIX system. Likewise, the relationship between the primary lottery game and the second-chance game or end of game drawing with respect to security had to be taken into account.

- With the current method, the ticket manufacturer generated the initial validation codes and printed such codes on the tickets in plain text format. These validation codes were the means for authenticating tickets in the primary lottery game. A fraudster gaining access to the validation codes at the ticket manufacturer could potentially determine wherein and whereto winning tickets were distributed, and the particular plain-text code printed on the winning tickets. The ticket manufacturer thus had a strong interest for developing a second chance game that was both user-friendly and secure.

- Even if a fraudster at the game provider with access to the game provider's server were somehow able to access individual tickets, the record of encrypted validation codes was essentially worthless to such fraudster in attempting to discern whether or not a ticket was a winning ticket. The record of encrypted validation codes was never linked back to a record of actual validation codes at the lottery ticket manufacturer. Thus, a fraudster having stolen a pack of tickets and having access to the record of encrypted validation codes could not use this information for trying to find out which of these tickets was a winning one. For this, he also would need to have access to the encryption algorithm. But even if the fraudster at the game provider were to gain access to the encryption algorithm, he would only be able to generate an encrypted validation code, and possibly compare this encrypted code to the record transmitted to the game provider. However, this would provide no useful information to the fraudster.

- If one would draw parallels, such a fraudulent determination of important information would correspond to getting access to the record of encrypted passwords on the UNIX server side as well as to stealing the corresponding user passwords and/or even the encryption algorithm. Such a scenario would be fatal for the use of the UNIX system. More specifically, in the case of a UNIX system, if a fraudster got to know the password of the user, he could use this password for entering the UNIX files of said user. A fraudster would not even need to have access to the record of encrypted validation codes and/or the encryption algorithm. Stealing a user password and gaining access to the UNIX system therefore led to a completely different scenario. Thus, a skilled person would not resort to the method described in D4 when wanting to offer security to the provider and comfort to the player for a second chance game.

- The flow of encrypted and plain-text validation codes between the parties served for purposes of the second chance game while ensuring security in the primary game. Thus, the method according to the invention kept up with the existing security standard for a primary game while at the same time using the already existing information, i.e. the individual validation code on the ticket, to provide for a unique method of enabling a secondary game. Accordingly, the ticket itself did not need to be altered compared to a ticket offering only one game. Only a record of encryption codes had to be established at the lottery provider as well as an algorithm, which calculated an encryption code based on the validation code transmitted by the player to the provider for the purpose of comparing the respective encrypted codes. The skilled person - even when being aware of the UNIX system according to D4 - would not come up with such a solution, which encompassed two different games having each their own security system, which however were linked via the same validation code on the ticket.

IX. The oral proceedings were held on 5 November 2015. Neither the appellant nor his representatives were present on the date of the oral proceedings. In a telephone conversation held by the board's registrar the representative's secretary informed her that the representative that had signed the last submissions in appeal was on holiday and the representative that had filed the appeal was not yet in his office. Thus the oral proceedings were held in the absence of the appellant.

--- APPEAL FACTS ---
I. The applicant appealed against the decision of the Examining Division, dispatched on 13 May 2014, to refuse the European patent application No. 04769910.3. The statement setting out the grounds of appeal was received on 16 September 2014.

II. The Examining Division refused the second and third auxiliary requests which were remitted to it following a decision by the present Board of Appeal in a different composition in case T 1983/09.

III. In case T 1983/09 the Board considered that the amendments made at the appeal stage had substantially changed the factual framework of the contested decision, and that an additional search could have been required to determine the relevant prior art (see penultimate paragraph of item 5.1 of that decision).

IV. In the decision under appeal in the present case the Examining Division held that the application did not meet the requirements of Article 56 EPC, having regard to document US 6 400 101 B1 (D5) in combination with the common general knowledge of a skilled person.

V. The appellant requested in writing that the decision under appeal be set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of a set of claims filed with the statement of grounds of appeal and corresponding to the claims of the former second auxiliary request.

VI. Claim 1 according to the appellant's sole request reads as follows.

"A system (20) for supplying power to an LED load (10), the system (20) comprising:

a LED driver module (30) operable to regulate a flow of a LED current (ILED) through the LED load (10) as a function of a temperature-dependent feedback signal (TDFS); and

a current controller module (60) in electric communication with said LED driver module (30) to communicate the temperature-dependent feedback signal (TDFS) to said LED driver module (10),

wherein said current controller module (60) is operable to generate the temperature-dependent feedback signal (TDFB) as a function of an operating temperature of the LED load (10) and the flow of the LED current (ILED) through the LED load (10), and

wherein said current controller module (600) includes:

means for generating a temperature feedback signal (VTF) as a function of a sensed operating temperature of the LED load (10);

wherein the temperature feedback signal is a temperature feedback voltage (VTF) and said current controller module (600) includes: a first operational amplifier (U1) operable to generate the temperature feedback voltage (VTF) as a function of the operating temperature of the LED load (10);

means for generating a current feedback signal (VCF) as a function of a sensed flow of the LED current (ILED) through the LED load (10);

wherein the current feedback signal is a current feedback voltage (VCF) and said current controller module (60) includes: a second operational amplifier (U2) operable to generate the current feedback voltage (VCF) as a function of the flow of the LED current (ILED) through the LED load (10); and

means for mixing the temperature feedback signal (VTF) and the current feedback signal (VCF) to yield the temperature and current-dependent feedback signal (TDFB),

wherein the temperature and current-dependent feedback signal (TDFB) is a feedback voltage generated as a mixture of the temperature feedback voltage (VTF) and the current feedback voltage (VCF)."

Claims 2 to 14 are dependent on claim 1.

VII. The appellant's arguments as far as they are relevant for the present decision can be summarised as follows:

The request in this appeal corresponded to the second auxiliary request addressed in the decision under appeal.

Claim 1 involved an inventive step over the disclosure of D5, D6 (US2002/130786 A1) and the alleged, but unproven "knowledge of the skilled person".

In D5, there was no disclosure of the following features which were required by claim 1 :

(i) a means for generating a temperature feedback signal which is a temperature feedback voltage (VTF) generated by a first operational amplifier (U1),

(ii) a means for generating a current feedback signal which is a current feedback voltage (VCF) generated by a second operational amplifier (U2), and

(iii) a means for mixing those signals to yield a temperature and current-dependent feedback signal (TDFB) which is a feedback voltage generated as a mixture of the temperature feedback voltage (VTF) and the current feedback voltage (VCF).

In the decision in case T 1983/09 the Board of Appeal held that D5 did not objectively disclose features (i) and (ii) identified above. The Board also stated that "D5 is indeed silent about the type of signal generated by the temperature regulation means and about the adder connected to the inverting input of the regulation means". Thus, according to the Board, D5 did not objectively disclose a temperature feedback voltage, so that feature (iii), which mentioned such a "temperature feedback voltage", was not disclosed either.

In paragraph 3.1.2 of the contested decision the Examining Division agreed that features (i) and (ii) were not disclosed in D5, but concluded, as stated in paragraph 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 of the decision that feature (iii) was disclosed in D5. This conclusion was not correct and contrary to the findings of fact stated by the Board of Appeal in the Reasons for the Decision in the case T 1983/09.

By providing these features in combination with the remaining features recited in claim 1, the claimed system provided a simple current controller module which provided a continuous feedback control of the LED as a function of both the sensed operating temperature of the LED load and the LED current through the LED load. In particular, it provided continuous control (page 11 , line 31 to page 12, line 6 of the original specification) over a wide temperature range. The two operational amplifiers operated independently to generate the respective voltage signals, which were then mixed. The use of the two operational amplifiers provided substantially aligned current and temperature control, and enabled the system to respond rapidly to current and temperature fluctuations.

As shown in Figure 3 of the present specification, the LED load was continuously controlled over a wide temperature range, based on the selection of a respective operational relationship between the resistive value of the LED load operating temperature sensor and the current through the LED load.

This technical effect of continuous control of current supplied to a LED driver with respect to temperature over an operating temperature range, in particular over a wide temperature range, had application, for example, in LED luminaires providing high quality light of a desired tuned colour temperature.

The objective technical problem starting from D5 was to provide a more simplified responsive feedback control of the power supply to the LED load so as to provide a temperature dependent control of the current supplied to the LED which could be continuous control of current supplied dependent on temperature over the operating temperature range.

The purpose of the circuitry of D5 on the other hand was primarily to prevent the LED from destruction resulting from an increased ambient temperature. Figure 3 of D5 showed the relationship between the forward current of the LED and ambient temperature. The current was constant up to an ambient temperature of 70°C and then was linearly reduced up to a maximum ambient temperature of 100°C, at which temperature the forward current of the LED was switched off. There was no disclosure or hint in D5 to solve the problem of providing a temperature dependent control of the current supplied to the LED as a continuous control of current supplied dependent on temperature over the operating temperature range.

Referring to paragraph 3.1.4 of the contested decision, even though operational amplifiers might have been known generally, there was no hint to the skilled person in D5 or D6, or in the common general knowledge, to somehow introduce two respective operational amplifiers into the circuit of Figure 8 of D5 in the specific manner recited in claim 1 and to process the specific respective signals recited in claim 1 in order to solve the correctly formulated objective technical problem. Moreover, no evidence of the common general knowledge had been provided.

The examining division relied upon D6 to assert that the skilled person, starting from D5, would "always consider the use of operational amplifiers for processing the measured signals". This unsubstantiated assertion indicated that the Examining Division had wrongly used hindsight in their analysis of inventive step.

TITLE: UNKNOWN

TYPE: US patent

DOCUMENT DESCRIPTION:

In accordance with the analysis of the content of D5 in case T 1983/09 the Board considers that document D5 discloses a system for supplying power to an LED load (cf. column 5, line 51 and figure 8) e.g. traffic lights (cf. column 4, lines 33 and 34), the system comprising:

a LED driver module (comparator and transistor T) operable to regulate a flow of a LED current ILED through the LED load as a function of a temperature-dependent feedback signal UREG (cf. figure 8 and column 7, lines 13 to 27); and

a current controller module (Regulator) in electric communication with said LED driver module to communicate the temperature-dependent feedback signal UREG to said LED driver module.

The current controller module is operable to generate a temperature-dependent feedback signal UREG in response to an operating temperature (signal input to the adder connected to the inverting input of the regulator) and the flow of the LED current through the LED load (signal at the non-inverting input of the regulator). The current controller module includes means for generating a temperature feedback signal as a function of a sensed operating temperature of the LED load (see column 4, lines 18 to 21 and column 7, lines 13 to 16 and figure 8: NTC and temperature regulation module) and means for generating a current feedback signal as a function of a sensed flow of the LED current ILED through the LED load (cf. column 2, lines 57 to 62). The current feedback signal is a current feedback voltage (output of the integrator is necessarily a voltage since it is applied to an input of an operational amplifier used as a regulator).

The system further comprises means for mixing the temperature feedback signal and the current feedback voltage (see figure 8: adder at the input of the regulator and the regulator drawn as an operational amplifier) to yield a temperature and current-dependent feedback voltage UREG.

TITLE: An architecture for ink annotations on Web documents

TYPE: Academic Paper

ABSTRACT:

There have been recent improvements in document technologies like the standardization of object interfaces to access and manipulate the properties of Web documents. There has also been significant progress in pen based computing for recognition of digital ink in desktops, tablets and handheld devices. These have necessitated a need for further research on annotation architectures for digital documents, specifically pen-based annotation systems. This paper presents an attempt to leverage the new standards of DHTML and W3C DOM that are being gradually implemented by popular browsers, to build a prototype of an ink annotation system with common components across browsers. One of the primary goals in this study is to semantically link ink data with underlying document elements like text and images. The system has three components: a) ink capture and rendering b) Ink Understanding, which recognizes and associates ink with the underlying document; and c) Ink storage and retrieval.

--- APPEAL FACTS ---
I. The appeal of the applicant (appellant) lies from the decision of the examining division announced at oral proceedings on 6 May 2011 to refuse European patent application n° 01 922 258.7.

II. The documents cited during the examination proceedings included the following:

D1: US-A-5,418,222

D2: EP-A-0 485 210

D5: J. Cappello et al., J. Controlled Release, 53 (1998), pages 105-117

III. The decision was based on two sets of claims filed with letter of 6 April 2011 as main request, and during oral proceedings on 6 May 2011 as auxiliary request.

Independent claim 1 of the main request related to a solvated compressed protein matrix material.

Independent claim 2 of the main request read as follows:

"2. A method of making a solvated compressed protein matrix material, comprising the steps of:

(a) preparing a coatable composition comprising one or more biocompatible protein materials and one or more biocompatible solvents;

(b) coating the composition to form a film;

(c) partially drying the coated film to a solvent content of 20% to 80% until the coated film can be formed into a non-brittle cohesive body;

(d) forming said cohesive body; and

(e) compressing the cohesive body to reduce bulk solvent and form a protein matrix material."

Independent claim 1 of the first auxiliary request read as follows:

"1. A method of making a solvated compressed protein matrix material, comprising the steps of:

(a) preparing a coatable composition comprising one or more biocompatible protein materials and one or more biocompatible solvents;

(b) coating the composition to form a film;

(c) partially drying the coated film to a solvent content of 35% to 80% until the coated film can be formed into a non-brittle cohesive body;

(d) forming said cohesive body; and

(e) compressing the cohesive body at a pressure of 689kPa to 689,500kPa (100psi to 100,000psi) for a time period of from 2 seconds to 48 hours to reduce bulk solvent and form a protein matrix material, having a solvent content of 30% to 50%."

IV. In its decision the examining division held inter alia that both D1 and D5 were prejudicial to the novelty of claim 1 of the main request.

The claims of the first auxiliary request met the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC. Novelty was established over D1 by virtue of the limitation of the solvent content of the product to the range of from 30 to 50%, and in that the pressure applied according to D1 is not further specified.

Claim 1 of the first auxiliary request did not meet the requirements of Article 56 EPC. D1 was the closest prior art since it related to collagen films for improving the sustained release delivery of a pharmaceutical, particularly in the context of enhancing wound healing. There was no evidence on file showing that the matrix material according to claim 1 was superior to that of D1 as alleged in terms of its strength, delayed degradation, and controlled delivery of an active agent. The pressure and time ranges recited were so broad that it was unlikely that an improvement could arise therefrom, and the claimed lower limit of 30% for the final solvent content of the material was within the range of the general teaching of D1 to provide from 10-30% glycerol. The objective technical problem was thus the provision of an alternative process for producing a solvated compressed protein matrix material. Such a process was conventional for the skilled person starting from the teaching of D1.

V. With the statement setting out the grounds of appeal dated 7 November 2011, the appellant submitted six sets of claims consisting of a main request and auxiliary requests 1-3, 5 and 6. A fourth claim set was not submitted, although the statement of grounds mentioned how such a request would be constructed.

Independent claim 2 was identical in the main request and the first to fourth auxiliary requests, and corresponded to independent claim 1 of the fifth auxiliary request. This claim was identical to claim 2 of the main request refused by the examining division (see point III above).

Independent claim 1 of the sixth auxiliary request corresponded to claim 1 of the first auxiliary request refused by the examining division (see point III above).

With the statement setting out the grounds of appeal the appellant furthermore submitted the following item of evidence:

Declaration of Dr Masters dated 6 November 2011

VI. In a communication dated 11 September 2015 issued in preparation for oral proceedings, the Board noted in the context of inventive step that the comparative data submitted with the Declaration of Dr Masters did not support the alleged effect of improved mechanical strength over the closest prior art D1. Consequently, with respect to claim 2 of the main request, the objective technical problem appeared to be the provision of an alternative process for the production of a protein matrix to that of D1, example 2, and the solution appeared obvious. Furthermore, the Board expressed the preliminary opinion that none of the amendments proposed according to the auxiliary requests would appear to lead to a different conclusion.

VII. Oral proceedings were held on 1 October 2015 in the absence of the appellant as announced with letter of 30 September 2015.

VIII. The appellant's arguments can be summarised as follows:

Main request

It was the method of manufacture which imparted the advantageous physical properties to the protein matrix material of the invention. The declaration of Dr Masters demonstrated that the material of claim 1, by virtue of its method of manufacture according to claim 2, was different from that disclosed in example 2 of D1, and displayed comparatively enhanced maximum tensile strength. As far as the process of preparation was concerned, D1 failed to disclose the features (c), (d) and (e) of claim 2. Claims 1 and 2 were thus novel. Inventive step was supported by the data provided in the declaration Dr Masters.

Auxiliary requests

Since the process claim according to the first, second, third and fifth auxiliary requests was identical to that of the main request, the arguments submitted in respect of the main request applied. Claim 1 of the sixth auxiliary request was further distinguished from D1 by the limited solvent content of the product, and was inventive by virtue of the unexpected advantageous properties conferred on the product, as demonstrated by the declaration of Dr Masters.

IX. The appellant requested in writing that the decision under appeal be set aside and a patent be granted on the basis of the set of claims of the main request, or alternatively on the basis of the sets of claims of the first to sixth auxiliary requests, all filed with the statement setting out the grounds of appeal.

  "reasoning": "1. The closest prior art is document D1, which already discloses a lottery ticket system in which each ticket carries a unique validation code and an authentication code is generated by a terminal and verified by a central server. 2. Claim 1 differs from D1 only in that the authentication code is called a ‘first encryption code’ that is stored by the lottery provider, and later a ‘second encryption code’ is generated from the player‑submitted validation code and compared with the stored code. 3. The technical problem is to provide a secure way of authenticating tickets for a second‑chance game. 4. Document D2 teaches the use of hash (or encryption) functions to store a digest of data and to compare a newly computed digest with the stored one. 5. Document D4 (UNIX password file) likewise teaches storing encrypted passwords and, upon receipt of a password, encrypting it again and comparing the two encrypted values. 6. A person skilled in the art, faced with the problem of securing the second‑chance game, would readily apply the well‑known hash/comparison technique of D2 or D4 to the ticket system of D1. The combination does not require any inventive activity; it is the straightforward use of a known cryptographic authentication method in a known lottery‑ticket environment. 7. The appellant’s arguments that the security requirements are specific to the lottery industry or that the second‑chance game introduces a non‑technical business feature do not create a technical contribution beyond the straightforward application of known encryption/hashing. 8. The Board’s provisional opinion already indicated that, even taking into account a “notorious lottery game” and D4, the invention lacks an inventive step. 9. Consequently, the claimed method is obvious in view of D1 combined with the teaching of D2 (or D4), and therefore does not fulfil the requirement of inventive step under Article 56 EPC.\n\nConclusion: The claimed invention does NOT satisfy the inventive‑step requirement.",

  "reasoning": "1. **Identify the closest prior art** – The Board and the examining division agreed that document D1 (US‑A‑5,418,222) is the closest prior art. D1 discloses collagen (protein) films that are partially dried, formed into a cohesive body and then compressed to produce a protein matrix material for wound‑healing applications.\n\n2. **Compare the claimed subject‑matter with D1** – The independent claim of the first auxiliary request (and the main request) differs from D1 mainly in:\n   - a narrower final solvent‑content range (30 %–50 % for the product, whereas D1 teaches 10 %–30 % glycerol or a broader range);\n   - a specified compression pressure of 689 kPa to 689 500 kPa (100 psi to 100 000 psi) and a time range of 2 s to 48 h, whereas D1 does not specify these parameters.\n   - the claim also adds the step of coating a film before partial drying, which is not expressly disclosed in D1.\n\n3. **Determine the technical effect** – The appellant relied on a declaration (Dr Masters) to argue that the claimed process yields a material with higher tensile strength and delayed degradation. The Board noted that the comparative data did not convincingly demonstrate any improvement over D1. Consequently, no reliable technical effect could be derived from the distinguishing features.\n\n4. **Formulate the objective technical problem** – Because no credible advantage was proven, the problem is reduced to the provision of an alternative way of producing a solvated compressed protein matrix material.\n\n5. **Assess obviousness** – A person skilled in the art, starting from D1, would recognize that:\n   - The film‑coating step is a routine way to obtain uniform layers of protein/solvent mixtures.\n   - Partial drying to a solvent content that still allows the film to be handled (20 %–80 %) is taught in D1 as a means to obtain a non‑brittle cohesive body.\n   - Varying the compression pressure and time within broad ranges is a normal optimisation of a known compression step; the skilled person would try different pressures and times to achieve the desired final solvent content.\n   - Adjusting the final solvent content to 30 %–50 % is simply a selection within the range already suggested by D1 (which mentions 10 %–30 % glycerol and generally teaches that solvent content can be varied).\n   Hence, the claimed modifications would have been obvious to the skilled person seeking an alternative process.\n\n6. **Conclusion** – Both the examining division and the Board found that the claimed subject‑matter lacks an inventive step. The lack of a demonstrated technical effect and the obviousness of the modifications lead to the conclusion that the invention does not fulfil the requirement of inventive step under Article 56 EPC.\n\n**Final answer:** No, the claimed invention does not satisfy the requirement of an inventive step.",

  "reasoning": "The European patent concerns a specific crystalline form of the compound anamorelin (the (3R)-l-(2‑methylalanyl‑D‑tryptophyl)‑3‑(phenylmethyl)‑3‑piperidinecarboxylic acid 1,2,2‑trimethylhydrazide), its hydrates, a defined X‑ray powder diffraction pattern, a process for preparing the crystals using methanol/water mixtures at defined temperatures, and pharmaceutical compositions/use thereof. \n\n**Closest prior art** – The only relevant document cited in the proceedings is D1 (US‑B‑6 576 648). D1 discloses the amorphous form of the same compound and, in example 1, a step (j) that produces a solid form by recrystallisation, but it does not disclose the particular crystalline polymorph claimed, nor the specific hydrate (di‑hydrate), nor the exact diffraction pattern, nor the detailed process parameters (solvent composition, temperature range, cooling step, etc.). \n\n**Problem‑solution approach**\n1. **Problem**: Provide a solid form of anamorelin with improved physicochemical properties (e.g., stability, reproducibility, suitable for pharmaceutical formulation). \n2. **Solution**: The patent defines a new crystalline polymorph (characterised by a specific powder‑diffraction pattern), optionally as a di‑hydrate, and a process that reliably yields this form using methanol/water mixtures at 65‑75 °C followed by cooling. \n3. **Technical effect**: The new polymorph exhibits distinct solid‑state characteristics (different diffraction pattern, defined hydrate level) that are advantageous for manufacturing and formulation. The process ensures consistent production of this form, which is not achieved by the generic recrystallisation suggested in D1. \n\n**Inventive step assessment**\n- D1 teaches that the amorphous material can be recrystallised, but it provides no guidance on which polymorph will be obtained, nor on the specific solvent ratios, temperature range, or hydrate control needed to obtain the claimed di‑hydrate. \n- The selection of methanol (or methanol/water mixtures) and the defined temperature window is not suggested or implied by D1; D1 merely mentions recrystallisation without specifying conditions that would lead to the claimed form. \n- The identification of the new polymorph by a unique set of diffraction peaks is a factual discovery that cannot be derived directly from D1. \n- Consequently, a person skilled in the art would not have been motivated to modify the generic recrystallisation of D1 in the precise way claimed, nor would they have expected the resulting solid to possess the disclosed properties. \n\nThe examining division originally found the claim obvious, but the Board, after the applicant’s amendments (defining the specific crystalline form, hydrate, diffraction pattern and detailed process), concluded that the main request fulfilled the EPC requirements. The final decision states that the main request was granted, indicating that the Board recognized an inventive step.\n\n**Conclusion**: The claimed invention is not obvious over D1 and therefore satisfies the requirement of an inventive step under the EPC.",

The \"dual media storage device\" (the closest prior art) discloses a system with two storage devices (a fast low‑capacity flash device and a slower high‑capacity magnetic device) and a storage controller that directs data to one or the other and copies data from the fast device to the slow device. It does not disclose a log‑structured file system (LFS), separate data‑layout formats for SSD and HDD, or the specific migration steps defined in claim 1.\n\n2. Compare claim 1 with the closest prior art. Claim 1 adds the following features that are not taught by the closest prior art:\n   - a log‑structured file system that implements a first data‑layout format for SSDs and a second data‑layout format for HDDs;\n   - migration that (i) identifies related file data stored according to the first layout, (ii) copies that data into a *log* of the LFS, and (iii) stores the blocks on the HDD using *regions* that contain a contiguous range of file block numbers;\n   - a \"write‑anywhere\" technique for SSDs and a \"sequential write\" technique for HDDs.\n\n3. Assess whether these distinguishing features would have been obvious to a skilled person in view of the cited documents (D1, D3, and the dual‑media device). The cited documents are only described as teaching hybrid storage and simple copying/caching. No indication is given that they teach the use of a log‑structured file system with two distinct layout formats, region‑based placement on HDDs, or the combination of write‑anywhere for SSDs with sequential write for HDDs. Implementing such a scheme requires specific technical teaching about LFS behaviour, region definition, and differing write strategies, which is not suggested by the prior art.\n\n4. Since the prior art does not disclose, nor renders obvious, the combination of a log‑structured file system with the two specialised data‑layout formats and the described migration and write techniques, the claimed subject‑matter involves an inventive step under Article 56 EPC.\n\nConclusion: The claimed invention satisfies the requirement of an inventive step.",

  "reasoning": "1. The closest prior art (D1) discloses a wireless internet remote access platform (WIRAP) that provides a mobile user with remote, centralized storage and a file‑browsing service accessed via a network. It teaches that the mobile device can request a list of files from a server, that access credentials may be required, and that the list can be presented on the handheld device.\n2. The claimed method (claim 1) differs from D1 mainly in the context of composing an e‑mail and in the way the selected remote file is attached to the e‑mail. The claim adds the steps of (i) receiving a user instruction to attach a file, (ii) receiving a second user instruction to send the e‑mail together with the selected file, and (iii) sending to a mail agent an attachment instruction that causes the mail agent to retrieve the file from the file‑delivery server (using the credentials) and to assemble the complete e‑mail.\n3. At the priority date of the application, it was part of the common general knowledge that a handheld device could compose e‑mail messages and that e‑mail clients could attach files. It was also known that a client could retrieve a file from a remote server (e.g. via HTTP, FTP, or other protocols) using supplied credentials.\n4. The skilled person, starting from D1, would therefore have a ready‑made remote file‑browsing service with credential handling. By applying the routine knowledge that an e‑mail client needs to attach a file, the skilled person would simply (a) invoke the file‑browsing service to let the user pick a file, (b) obtain the necessary credentials, (c) pass the selected file identifier and the credentials to the mail agent, and (d) let the mail agent retrieve the file and include it in the e‑mail. All these steps are straightforward combinations of the teaching of D1 with the well‑known e‑mail composition functions of a handheld device.\n5. None of the features of the claim introduces a technical effect that goes beyond the normal interaction of a remote storage service and an e‑mail client. The claim does not solve a technical problem that the prior art does not already address; it merely implements a known business‑process (attaching a remote file to an e‑mail) using known building blocks.\n6. Consequently, the subject‑matter of claim 1 lacks an inventive step under Article 56 EPC because it would have been obvious to the skilled person in view of D1 combined with common general knowledge.\n\nConclusion: The claimed invention does **not** satisfy the requirement of an inventive step.",

It therefore teaches receiving input signals that are associated with specific regions (nodes) of a web page.\n2. D2 (DOM Level 2 Events Specification) teaches how events are generated, propagated and handled for DOM nodes, including the possibility of defining custom event types and listeners.\n3. By combining D12’s teaching of associating input with DOM nodes with D2’s teaching of event handling, a skilled person would readily arrive at a method that (a) receives input signals linked to different DOM nodes, (b) determines separate touch events for each node, (c) combines those events to recognise a higher‑level gesture, and (d) dispatches the resulting gesture event to the web page for processing.\n4. The claim’s further features – that the touch events belong to the standard set (touch‑start, touch‑move, touch‑end, touch‑cancel), that they occur at substantially the same time, and that the web page may be an HTML/markup document with JavaScript actions – are all either explicitly disclosed in D12 (ink annotation on HTML/DHTML pages) or are standard knowledge in the field (as reflected in D10 and D11) and therefore would be obvious to a person skilled in the art.\n5. Consequently, each essential feature of claim 1 is either directly disclosed in D12/D2 or would be an obvious modification for a skilled person seeking to handle multi‑touch input on web pages. No technical effect beyond the straightforward combination of the teachings is demonstrated.\n6. Under the problem‑solution approach, the objective technical problem is to provide a method for handling touches on a web page.

  "reasoning": "1. **Identify the closest prior art** – The Examining Division and the Board both pointed to document D1 (\"Representing the relationship between items in logical bill‑of‑material…\") as the most relevant disclosure. D1 teaches a logical bill‑of‑material (GBOM) in which a parent product and its variant components are related by compatibility matrices and logical rules. \n\n2. **Determine the technical problem** – The patent aims to provide a CAD/CAM‑compatible product data‑model that (i) stores a parent assembly with children, (ii) distinguishes *component‑usages* (instances of components) from *logical component‑usages* (abstract logical roles), and (iii) interconnects these hierarchically so that designers can select configurations efficiently.\n\n3. **Compare the claim with D1** – D1 already discloses:\n   - a parent assembly and child components,\n   - a logical representation of variant relationships (compatibility constraints),\n   - the notion of \"logical\" items that control which concrete component variants may be used.\n   What D1 does **not** explicitly disclose is the concrete data‑model terminology of “component‑usage” and “logical component‑usage” as separate objects stored in memory and hierarchically linked to a parent assembly.\n\n4. **Consider the additional teaching of D3** – Document D3 (STEP product modelling) teaches a hierarchical product structure stored in a computer‑readable model, with assemblies, parts and their relationships. It provides the technical means for representing assemblies and their constituent parts in a CAD environment.\n\n5. **Combine D1 and D3** – A skilled person, faced with the problem of implementing D1’s logical GBOM in a CAD/CAM system, would naturally turn to the STEP modelling framework of D3 to obtain a concrete hierarchical data‑model. By mapping D1’s logical compatibility matrices onto STEP’s assembly/part hierarchy, the skilled person would arrive at a model that includes:\n   - a stored parent assembly with child components (from D3),\n   - a set of component‑usages (the concrete instances of parts), and\n   - a set of logical component‑usages (the compatibility/role information from D1) linked to the component‑usages.\n   This yields exactly the structure recited in claim 1 of the main request.\n\n6. **Assess obviousness** – The combination does not require any inventive teaching beyond what is already disclosed:\n   - D1 teaches the need for logical component‑usages to control variant selection.\n   - D3 teaches how to store assemblies and parts hierarchically in a CAD‑compatible model.\n   - The skilled person would therefore combine the two teachings in an obvious manner to obtain a CAD/CAM‑compatible product data‑model as claimed.\n\n7. **Effect of D4** – Document D4 (2006) introduces the notion of a “lightweight copy” of a component. However, D4 was published after the filing date of the patent (the application was filed in 2003). Consequently, D4 cannot be taken into account as prior art for assessing inventive step. Its teaching therefore cannot rescue the claim.\n\n8. **Conclusion** – Because the claimed features are directly and obviously derivable from the combination of D1 and D3, the invention does not involve an inventive step under Article 56 EPC.\n\n**Final answer:** No, the claimed invention does not satisfy the requirement of an inventive step.",

  "reasoning": "1. **Identify the closest prior art**: The examining division and the board considered D2 (enhanced symbol‑mapping based on bit priority) together with D7 (3GPP TS 25.212, which defines turbo coding, rate matching and generic interleaving) as the closest prior art. The \"Adaptive HARQ\" document is also mentioned but it does not disclose the specific interleaver architecture of the claim.\n\n2. **Determine the distinguishing features** of claim 1 over D2/D7:\n   - Two separate interleavers (first for systematic bits, second for parity bits) that write bits *row‑by‑row* from a first to a last row.\n   - After the row‑wise write, each interleaver performs an *inter‑column permutation* according to a determined rule.\n   - The modulator *alternately collects* the permuted bits *column‑by‑column* from the two interleavers.\n   - The two interleavers have the *same size*; if the systematic bits exceed the capacity of the first interleaver, the excess bits are written into the second interleaver.\n   - Specific handling for 16‑QAM (alternating 2‑bit groups).\n\n   D2 teaches a priority‑based symbol mapping but does not disclose the row‑wise write, the inter‑column permutation, the equal‑size dual interleaver structure, nor the overflow‑into‑the‑second‑interleaver rule. D7 describes generic turbo‑coding, rate‑matching and interleaving, but again does not teach the particular combination of row‑wise write, column‑wise collection, equal‑size dual buffers, or the overflow handling.\n\n3. **Technical effect of the distinguishing features**: The arrangement solves the problem of efficiently handling a variable number of systematic and parity bits after rate‑matching, ensuring that the modulator can always obtain a balanced stream of bits for each modulation symbol (especially for 16‑QAM) without wasting buffer space and while preserving the order required for correct decoding.\n\n4. **Formulate the objective technical problem**: Provide a method/apparatus that reliably maps turbo‑coded systematic and parity bits onto modulation symbols when the numbers of bits after rate‑matching are not equal, while keeping the implementation simple and compatible with existing 3GPP structures.\n\n5. **Assess obviousness**: For the skilled person, D2 suggests using separate buffers for systematic and parity bits and mapping them according to priority. D7 provides the generic interleaver and rate‑matching functions. However, none of these documents suggest:\n   - writing the bits row‑by‑row and then performing an inter‑column permutation;\n   - using two *identical‑size* interleavers and diverting overflow bits from the first to the second;\n   - the specific column‑wise alternating collection required for 16‑QAM.\n   The combination of these features would require a non‑trivial technical insight that is not directly taught or suggested by the prior art. Consequently, the skilled person would not arrive at the claimed solution in an obvious manner.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The claimed invention contains technical features that are not disclosed or rendered obvious by D2, D7 (or the Adaptive HARQ document).

  "reasoning": "1. Identify the closest prior art. The decision under appeal and the appellant’s own submissions agree that the closest prior art is the Grafton® DBM Crunch product disclosed in document (19). This product is a blend of demineralised bone fibres and cortical bone chips and does not contain any tubular mesh covering.\n\n2. Determine the distinguishing features of claim 1 over the closest prior art. The claim adds a tubular delivery system comprising a poly(glycolic acid) (PGA) mesh covering, an attachment mechanism (wrap, suture, etc.) and the feature that the covering retains the DBM substance for placement and facilitates transfer of the substance upon implantation.\n\n3. Ascertain the technical problem solved. The appellant frames the problem as providing an improved bone‑void filler that gives better clinical performance (bone fusion) than Grafton® DBM Crunch. The improvement is supported by the declaration of Dr D Shimko showing superior performance of the claimed “Magnifuse® DBM” over the comparative product.\n\n4. Assess whether the distinguishing features would have been obvious to the skilled person. Documents (2) EP‑A‑82621, (7) US‑A‑2004/220615 and (17) WO 2008/013763 are cited by the Examining Division as teaching porous mesh coverings for bone implants. These documents disclose the use of PGA or similar resorbable meshes, attachment means (wraps, sutures, cable ties) and the concept of a tubular or sheet‑like covering that retains bone graft material and allows its release as the mesh degrades. Consequently, a skilled person seeking to improve a DBM product would have been motivated to combine the teaching of document (19) with the teaching of (2), (7) or (17) to obtain a delivery system that is easier to handle and that keeps the graft material in place until implantation.\n\n5. Consider the appellant’s argument of an unexpected technical effect. The appellant argues that a mesh covering would act as a barrier and that the prior art (23) teaches that such a barrier is undesirable, therefore the improvement would be counter‑intuitive. However, the cited mesh‑covering documents themselves present the mesh as a scaffold that retains graft material while still permitting tissue ingrowth; they do not describe the mesh as a prohibitive barrier. Moreover, the improvement demonstrated in the declaration could be attributable to other variables (e.g., formulation of the DBM, carrier, processing) rather than solely to the presence of the mesh covering. Under the problem‑solution approach, an unexpected effect must be directly linked to the distinguishing features. The case data do not establish a clear causal link between the mesh covering and the improved clinical outcome.\n\n6. Apply the EPO case law on obviousness. When the prior art provides a teaching to use a resorbable mesh covering for bone grafts, and the skilled person would have had a reasonable expectation that adding such a covering to a DBM product would solve handling and placement problems, the combination is considered obvious unless a credible, non‑obvious technical effect is proved. The evidence supplied does not meet this threshold.\n\n7. Conclusion. The distinguishing features (PGA mesh covering with attachment means) are disclosed in the prior art (2), (7) and (17) and would have been obvious to combine with the DBM product of document (19). The alleged unexpected performance improvement is not sufficiently substantiated as being directly caused by the mesh covering. Therefore, the claimed invention does not meet the requirement of an inventive step under Article 56 EPC.\n\nAnswer: No.",

Consequently, the combination of two dedicated op‑amps is a distinguishing technical feature.\n\n3. **Technical effect of the distinguishing features** – The appellant demonstrates that the two‑op‑amp arrangement provides continuous, rapid and accurately aligned control of LED current over a wide temperature range, which is not achieved by the single‑regulator architecture of D5.\n\n4. **Formulate the objective technical problem** – Starting from D5, the problem is to provide a simpler, more responsive feedback circuit that yields continuous temperature‑dependent current control for an LED load.\n\n5. **Assess obviousness** – The Examining Division argued that D6 would lead the skilled person to use operational amplifiers, but the case data states that no concrete teaching or evidence of such common‑general‑knowledge was presented.  The Board in T 1983/09 explicitly noted the lack of any hint in D5, D6 or the common general knowledge to introduce **two** separate operational amplifiers in the specific configuration claimed.
