TITLE: Representing the relationship between items in logical
bill-of-material to support customers’ request for quotation for
make-to-order products

TYPE: Academic Paper

ABSTRACT: 

For make-to-order products in which the specification of some component-product variants are to be defined by
customers, it is almost impossible to develop a bill-of-material system that support customers’ requests for quotation
(RFQ) response activities usingthe existingbill-of-material concepts. To deal with this problem, a new technique
for representingthe relationship between parent-product variants and component-product variants in the generic
bill-of-material (GBOM) structure is developed. The new technique is based on an assumption that the relationship
between any two components in a product structure has pairwise independent property. The technique represents the
relationship with compatibility constraints in the form of matrices and rules. The new representation provides users
with a means to describingvariants of make-to-order products as well as supportingthe customers’ RFQ response
activities with only a limited amount of data which is comprehensive, easy to maintain, and easy to understand.

TITLE: Adaptive HARQ for fixed TTI using soft acknowledgement

TYPE: Working Group Document

DOCUMENT:

We showed a physical layer structure and coding scheme that combines the advantages of the conventional fixed 
and variable TTI proposals by allowing to use two parallel data streams for each TTI. The main benefits are: 
• flexible mapping of required retransmission energy using MCS level and code rate adaptation, as 
well as bit mapping, 
• reduced interference, 
• allows soft-combining of retransmissions at different MCS levels,
• high frame fill efficiency, 
• increased throughput, 
• maintains simplicity of fixed TTI. 
The concepts presented in this paper are suitable for incremental redundancy, but can also be adapted to Chase 
combining.

TITLE: Design and implementation of a wireless internet remote access platform

TYPE: Academic Paper

ABSTRACT:

Recently, mobile networks and internet technologies have been widely developed for the voice communication and information retrieval services all over the world. Compared with the wire-line internet environment, mobile networks have lower bandwidth, longer transmission latency and unreliable connection, and the capability of mobile terminals is restricted by the limited memory size, lower CPU computation capability and inconvenient I/O interface. These limitations restrict the development of the wireless internet applications. In this paper, we design and implement a ‘wireless internet remote access platform’ (WIRAP). The WIRAP platform interconnects the wireless network and internet to provide mobile users a remote centralized storage and computation environment. A mobile user can store large volume of data and execute complex computations on WIRAP instead of on the mobile terminals. WIRAP supports different network interfaces (e.g. short message service (SMS), wireless markup language (WML) and hyper text markup language (HTML) and users may use terminals (with different network capabilities) to access WIRAP.

CLAIMS

1. A method for implementing a second-chance game or an end of game
drawing for players of a lottery game, comprising the steps of:

providing tickets (110) for the lottery game, wherein the tickets
(110) are each assigned a unique validation code (112);

applying an algorithm to generate a unique, first encryption
code (120) for each ticket validation code (112);

storing the first encryption code (120) in a first record (130) ata
lottery provider;

distributing the tickets (110) for possession by players of the lot-
tery game;

conducting the lottery game;

allowing players to submit the unique validation codes (112) for
registration into a lottery provider's database;

on the part of the lottery provider, applying the algorithm to the
submitted validation codes (112) to create a second encryption code
(135) for each submitted validation code (112);

on the part of the lottery provider, comparing the second en-
cryption code (135) with the record (130) of first encryption codes
(120) to determine whether a match exists; and

on the part of the lottery provider, if a match exists, registering
the ticket (110) in a second record (155) by storing the second encryp-
tion code (135) for the ticket (110), wherein the second record (155)
comprises only those encryption codes (135) verified to be eligible for
the second-chance or end of game drawing; and

conducting the second-chance or end of game drawing with the
tickets (110), whose encryption codes (135) are stored in the second
record (155).

2. The method according to claim 1, wherein said registering step com-
prises recording identification information provided by the player, and
wherein winners in the second-chance or end of game drawing are no-
tified by the lottery provider based on the identification information so
that the winners need not retain the lottery ticket (110) after said regis-
tration step.

3. The method according to claim 1, further comprising the step of reject-
ing a submitted validation code (112) where there is no match be-
tween the second encryption code (135) and the record (130) of first
encryption codes (120).

4. The method according to claim 1, wherein said step of allowing play-
ers to submit the unique validation code (112) comprises providing a
website accessible over the internet by which players may provide the
unique validation code (112) from the ticket (110).

5. The method according to claim 4, wherein the website locks out a
player who submits three validation codes (112) that do not result in a
match.

6. The method according to claim 4, wherein for a predetermined period
of time the website locks out a player who submits three validation
codes (112) that do not result in a match.

7. The method according to claim 1, wherein said comparing step further
comprises determining whether a validation code (112) that results in
a matching first and second encryption code (120, 135) has already
been submitted.

DOCUMENT DESCRIPTION:

In accordance with the analysis of the content of D5 in case T 1983/09 the Board considers that document D5 discloses a system for supplying power to an LED load (cf. column 5, line 51 and figure 8) e.g. traffic lights (cf. column 4, lines 33 and 34), the system comprising:

a LED driver module (comparator and transistor T) operable to regulate a flow of a LED current ILED through the LED load as a function of a temperature-dependent feedback signal UREG (cf. figure 8 and column 7, lines 13 to 27); and

a current controller module (Regulator) in electric communication with said LED driver module to communicate the temperature-dependent feedback signal UREG to said LED driver module.

The current controller module is operable to generate a temperature-dependent feedback signal UREG in response to an operating temperature (signal input to the adder connected to the inverting input of the regulator) and the flow of the LED current through the LED load (signal at the non-inverting input of the regulator). The current controller module includes means for generating a temperature feedback signal as a function of a sensed operating temperature of the LED load (see column 4, lines 18 to 21 and column 7, lines 13 to 16 and figure 8: NTC and temperature regulation module) and means for generating a current feedback signal as a function of a sensed flow of the LED current ILED through the LED load (cf. column 2, lines 57 to 62). The current feedback signal is a current feedback voltage (output of the integrator is necessarily a voltage since it is applied to an input of an operational amplifier used as a regulator).

The system further comprises means for mixing the temperature feedback signal and the current feedback voltage (see figure 8: adder at the input of the regulator and the regulator drawn as an operational amplifier) to yield a temperature and current-dependent feedback voltage UREG.

TITLE: An architecture for ink annotations on Web documents

TYPE: Academic Paper

ABSTRACT:

There have been recent improvements in document technologies like the standardization of object interfaces to access and manipulate the properties of Web documents. There has also been significant progress in pen based computing for recognition of digital ink in desktops, tablets and handheld devices. These have necessitated a need for further research on annotation architectures for digital documents, specifically pen-based annotation systems. This paper presents an attempt to leverage the new standards of DHTML and W3C DOM that are being gradually implemented by popular browsers, to build a prototype of an ink annotation system with common components across browsers. One of the primary goals in this study is to semantically link ink data with underlying document elements like text and images. The system has three components: a) ink capture and rendering b) Ink Understanding, which recognizes and associates ink with the underlying document; and c) Ink storage and retrieval.

The closest prior art (US patent on software product authentication) discloses a system where a terminal creates a first key that is used to generate an authentication code printed on a lottery ticket, and a second key that is transmitted to a central server for later verification of that authentication code. The server stores the second key and later receives the authentication code to verify its validity.\n2. Claim 1 of the patent differs from the prior art in several respects: (a) it uses a single algorithm (e.g., MD5) to generate a *first encryption code* at ticket issuance and a *second encryption code* at the time the player submits the validation code; (b) it stores the first encryption code in a first record before the tickets are distributed; (c) it creates a second record that contains only those second encryption codes that have been verified as eligible for a \"second‑chance\" or end‑of‑game drawing; (d) it conducts a second‑chance drawing using the entries stored in that second record; (e) optional features such as a web‑based submission portal, lock‑out after failed attempts, removable coating, etc.\n3. The technical problem to be solved can be formulated as: \"How to provide a secure, fraud‑resistant method for allowing lottery players to enter tickets that have already been used in the primary draw into a subsequent second‑chance drawing.\"\n4. The solution proposed in the claim is essentially a straightforward adaptation of the known authentication‑code system of the prior art: instead of using two different keys (first key for printing, second key for verification), the skilled person could simply use the same deterministic algorithm on the validation code at both stages, store the resulting code, and later compare a newly generated code with the stored one. The creation of a separate \"second record\" for eligible entries is a routine data‑management step that any skilled programmer would implement to keep track of which tickets have passed the verification test.\n5.

  "reasoning": "**Step 1 – Identify the closest prior art**\nThe closest document is the US patent titled *Dual media storage device*. It discloses a system that combines a fast, low‑capacity non‑volatile memory (flash) with a slower, high‑capacity magnetic disk. A storage controller directs incoming data to either device, can act as a cache, and copies data from the flash to the disk. Overlapping logical address spaces and simple copy‑back mechanisms are taught.\n\n**Step 2 – Determine the distinguishing features of claim 1**\nThe claimed storage system (claim 1) differs from the prior art in the following respects:\n1. The hybrid media are managed by a **log‑structured file system (LFS)** that implements two *different* data‑layout formats – a *first* format for SSDs and a *second* format for HDDs.\n2. The SSD layout uses a **write‑anywhere** technique, allowing data to be placed anywhere in free space.\n3. The HDD layout uses a **sequential‑write** technique, streaming data into **regions** where each region contains a contiguous range of file‑block numbers.\n4. Migration from SSD to HDD is performed by **identifying related file data**, **copying it into the LFS log**, and then **storing the blocks on the HDD according to the second layout** (region‑based placement).\n5. The system performs **initial placement, migration and write allocation** under the control of the LFS, with block‑level movement without manual enforcement (as further defined in claim 2).\n\nThe prior art does **not** disclose any of the above: it contains no LFS, no distinct layout formats, no write‑anywhere vs sequential‑write distinction, and no region‑based contiguous‑block placement on the HDD.\n\n**Step 3 – Assess whether the distinguishing features would have been obvious**\n- *Log‑structured file system*: LFS is known in the art, primarily for flash/SSD because it mitigates erase‑block constraints. Its use for magnetic disks is not taught in the prior art, which instead relies on conventional block‑based file systems. Combining an LFS with a hybrid SSD/HDD system and defining two separate layouts is a non‑trivial technical contribution.\n- *Two different layout formats*: The idea of using a layout that exploits the strengths of each media (random‑write‑friendly SSD vs sequential‑write‑friendly HDD) is not suggested by the prior art, which treats the fast device merely as a cache.\n- *Region‑based contiguous block numbers on HDD*: This specific organization, aimed at enabling efficient sequential streaming, is not disclosed. The prior art merely mentions copying data from flash to disk without any particular block‑number scheme.\n- *Migration via the LFS log*: Copying data into a log before placing it on the HDD is a concrete procedural step absent from the prior art. The prior art’s migration is a simple copy operation driven by the controller, not mediated by an LFS.\n- *Write‑anywhere vs sequential‑write techniques*: The distinction and the corresponding policies are not taught. The prior art’s controller does not implement such complementary write strategies.\n\nA skilled person starting from the dual‑media system would recognise the need for cache management but would have no motivation or teaching to replace the conventional cache controller with a full‑blown log‑structured file system that defines two separate data‑layout formats and region‑based placement. The combination of these features solves a technical problem (efficient use of SSD random‑write capability together with HDD sequential‑write efficiency) in a manner that is not derivable in an obvious way from the cited document and the common general knowledge.\n\n**Step 4 – Conclusion**\nBecause the claimed subject‑matter contains several technical features that are not disclosed or suggested by the closest prior art, and because the combination of these features would not have been obvious to a person skilled in the art, the invention meets the requirement of an inventive step under Article 56 EPC.\n\n**Answer**: Yes, the claimed invention satisfies the requirement of an inventive step.",

TITLE: Representing the relationship between items in logical
bill-of-material to support customers’ request for quotation for
make-to-order products

TYPE: Academic Paper

ABSTRACT: 

For make-to-order products in which the specification of some component-product variants are to be defined by
customers, it is almost impossible to develop a bill-of-material system that support customers’ requests for quotation
(RFQ) response activities usingthe existingbill-of-material concepts. To deal with this problem, a new technique
for representingthe relationship between parent-product variants and component-product variants in the generic
bill-of-material (GBOM) structure is developed. The new technique is based on an assumption that the relationship
between any two components in a product structure has pairwise independent property. The technique represents the
relationship with compatibility constraints in the form of matrices and rules. The new representation provides users
with a means to describingvariants of make-to-order products as well as supportingthe customers’ RFQ response
activities with only a limited amount of data which is comprehensive, easy to maintain, and easy to understand.

TITLE: Adaptive HARQ for fixed TTI using soft acknowledgement

TYPE: Working Group Document

DOCUMENT:

We showed a physical layer structure and coding scheme that combines the advantages of the conventional fixed 
and variable TTI proposals by allowing to use two parallel data streams for each TTI. The main benefits are: 
• flexible mapping of required retransmission energy using MCS level and code rate adaptation, as 
well as bit mapping, 
• reduced interference, 
• allows soft-combining of retransmissions at different MCS levels,
• high frame fill efficiency, 
• increased throughput, 
• maintains simplicity of fixed TTI. 
The concepts presented in this paper are suitable for incremental redundancy, but can also be adapted to Chase 
combining.

TITLE: Design and implementation of a wireless internet remote access platform

TYPE: Academic Paper

ABSTRACT:

Recently, mobile networks and internet technologies have been widely developed for the voice communication and information retrieval services all over the world. Compared with the wire-line internet environment, mobile networks have lower bandwidth, longer transmission latency and unreliable connection, and the capability of mobile terminals is restricted by the limited memory size, lower CPU computation capability and inconvenient I/O interface. These limitations restrict the development of the wireless internet applications. In this paper, we design and implement a ‘wireless internet remote access platform’ (WIRAP). The WIRAP platform interconnects the wireless network and internet to provide mobile users a remote centralized storage and computation environment. A mobile user can store large volume of data and execute complex computations on WIRAP instead of on the mobile terminals. WIRAP supports different network interfaces (e.g. short message service (SMS), wireless markup language (WML) and hyper text markup language (HTML) and users may use terminals (with different network capabilities) to access WIRAP.

DOCUMENT DESCRIPTION:

In accordance with the analysis of the content of D5 in case T 1983/09 the Board considers that document D5 discloses a system for supplying power to an LED load (cf. column 5, line 51 and figure 8) e.g. traffic lights (cf. column 4, lines 33 and 34), the system comprising:

a LED driver module (comparator and transistor T) operable to regulate a flow of a LED current ILED through the LED load as a function of a temperature-dependent feedback signal UREG (cf. figure 8 and column 7, lines 13 to 27); and

a current controller module (Regulator) in electric communication with said LED driver module to communicate the temperature-dependent feedback signal UREG to said LED driver module.

The current controller module is operable to generate a temperature-dependent feedback signal UREG in response to an operating temperature (signal input to the adder connected to the inverting input of the regulator) and the flow of the LED current through the LED load (signal at the non-inverting input of the regulator). The current controller module includes means for generating a temperature feedback signal as a function of a sensed operating temperature of the LED load (see column 4, lines 18 to 21 and column 7, lines 13 to 16 and figure 8: NTC and temperature regulation module) and means for generating a current feedback signal as a function of a sensed flow of the LED current ILED through the LED load (cf. column 2, lines 57 to 62). The current feedback signal is a current feedback voltage (output of the integrator is necessarily a voltage since it is applied to an input of an operational amplifier used as a regulator).

The system further comprises means for mixing the temperature feedback signal and the current feedback voltage (see figure 8: adder at the input of the regulator and the regulator drawn as an operational amplifier) to yield a temperature and current-dependent feedback voltage UREG.

TITLE: An architecture for ink annotations on Web documents

TYPE: Academic Paper

ABSTRACT:

There have been recent improvements in document technologies like the standardization of object interfaces to access and manipulate the properties of Web documents. There has also been significant progress in pen based computing for recognition of digital ink in desktops, tablets and handheld devices. These have necessitated a need for further research on annotation architectures for digital documents, specifically pen-based annotation systems. This paper presents an attempt to leverage the new standards of DHTML and W3C DOM that are being gradually implemented by popular browsers, to build a prototype of an ink annotation system with common components across browsers. One of the primary goals in this study is to semantically link ink data with underlying document elements like text and images. The system has three components: a) ink capture and rendering b) Ink Understanding, which recognizes and associates ink with the underlying document; and c) Ink storage and retrieval.

  "reasoning": "1. The claimed invention relates to a specific crystalline form of a peptide‑like compound (a (3R)‑4‑(2‑methylalanyl‑D‑tryptophyl)‑3‑(phenylmethyl)‑3‑piperidinecarboxylic acid 1,2,2‑trimethylhydrazide), its hydrates, an X‑ray powder diffraction pattern, a process for preparing it using methanol/water solvents, and pharmaceutical uses.  \n2. The closest prior art supplied is a US patent concerning a computer‑implemented method for storing and managing tagged data elements. It discloses nothing about chemical compounds, crystal forms, pharmaceutical compositions, or any process for preparing such compounds.  \n3. Under the EPO, inventive step (Art. 56 EPC) requires that the invention is not obvious to the skilled person in view of the closest prior art. The skilled person in the field of medicinal chemistry would look to prior art concerning peptide synthesis, crystallisation, polymorphism, etc. The cited software patent provides no teaching, suggestion or motivation that would lead the skilled chemist to the specific compound, its crystalline hydrate/anhydrate, the defined diffraction pattern, or the particular methanol‑water precipitation process.  \n4. Because the prior art is unrelated, there is no logical route from the teaching of the prior art to the claimed subject‑matter. Consequently, the claimed invention would not have been obvious to the skilled person.  \n5. Therefore the invention satisfies the requirement of an inventive step under the EPC.",

Baseline Session for T226611 (Run 2) Finished. Verdict: YES

[LLM RESPONSE]:
{
  "reasoning": "1. Identify the closest prior art: the provided product information lists many DBM (demineralized bone matrix) products (putties, gels, sheets, cylindrical plugs, flexible sheets, etc.) but none describe a tubular delivery system with a poly(glycolic acid) (PGA) mesh covering and a physical attachment mechanism.\n2. Determine the distinguishing features of claim 1 over the prior art:\n   - a tubular covering that includes a PGA mesh;\n   - a physical attachment mechanism selected from wrap, suture, wire, string, elastic band, cable or cable tie;\n   - the covering defines a first compartment that contains a mixture of surface demineralized bone chips and demineralized bone fibers;\n   - the covering is configured to retain the substance for placement and to facilitate transfer of the substance (or surrounding material) upon implantation.\n3. Assess whether these distinguishing features are disclosed or suggested by the prior art. The prior art only discloses DBM in various carriers (putty, gel, sheet, cylindrical plugs) and does not teach a tubular PGA mesh, nor any attachment mechanism integrated with such a covering. No teaching is found that would lead the skilled person to combine a PGA mesh tube with DBM chips/fibers for the purpose of retention and transfer at a surgical site.\n4. Consider whether the combination would have been obvious. While PGA meshes are known in the art for resorbable sutures or scaffolds, the prior art does not provide any motivation or teaching to use such a mesh as a tubular delivery system for a DBM mixture, nor to incorporate the specific attachment mechanisms listed. The skilled person would not have a reasonable expectation that the claimed system would solve the problem of retaining and delivering the DBM mixture in the manner defined in the claim.\n5. Since the prior art does not render the claimed subject‑matter obvious, the invention involves an inventive step under Article 56 EPC.\n\nConclusion: The claimed invention satisfies the requirement of an inventive step.",

Baseline Session for T159413 (Run 2) Finished. Verdict: YES

[LLM RESPONSE]:
{
  "reasoning": "1. Identify the closest prior art (WIRAP). The paper discloses a wireless platform that provides remote centralized storage and computation for mobile users. It mentions support for various network interfaces (SMS, WML, HTML) and the ability for users to store large data and run computations remotely. 2. Compare the disclosure of WIRAP with claim 1. The claim requires a method for composing an e‑mail on a hand‑held device that (a) receives a user instruction to attach a file, (b) requests a file‑browsing service on a file‑delivery server, (c) prompts for and furnishes access credentials, (d) presents the file list on the device, (e) sends an attachment instruction containing the selected file identifier and the credentials to a mail agent, and (f) the mail agent retrieves the file from the server and assembles the complete e‑mail. 3. Differences: – WIRAP never mentions e‑mail composition, attachment handling, or a mail agent. – WIRAP does not disclose a file‑browsing service that returns a list to the hand‑held UI, nor the exchange of credentials for that purpose. – The specific “attachment instruction” that triggers the mail agent to fetch the remote file and assemble the e‑mail is absent. 4. Technical effect of the claimed features: enables a hand‑held device to attach a remote file to an e‑mail without first downloading the file, reduces bandwidth and storage requirements on the device, and integrates credential handling securely into the e‑mail workflow. 5. Assessment of obviousness: A skilled person in 2006‑2007 would be familiar with (i) e‑mail clients on mobile devices that attach locally stored files, (ii) remote file storage services, and (iii) the use of credentials to access protected resources. However, none of the cited teaching suggests combining these elements in the particular sequence claimed – i.e. requesting a remote file‑browsing service, presenting the list on the device, transmitting an attachment instruction that carries the credentials to a separate mail‑agent which then fetches the file and assembles the e‑mail. The prior art provides only a generic remote‑storage platform; it does not teach that a mail agent can use the same credentials supplied for browsing to retrieve the file for attachment, nor that the attachment instruction should be sent separately from the e‑mail body. Consequently, the skilled person would not arrive at the claimed solution in an obvious manner. 6. Conclusion: The claimed method contains technical features not disclosed or suggested by the closest prior art and provides a non‑obvious technical contribution. Therefore, the invention satisfies the requirement of an inventive step under Article 56 EPC.",

Extract the distinguishing features of claim 1 (and dependent claims) over the prior art:\n   - A product data‑model stored in computer memory that hierarchically interconnects a parent assembly, component‑usages and *logical* component‑usages.\n   - Logical component‑usages are used for selecting component‑usages and for identifying the role of component‑usages in an assembly configuration.\n   - Subsequent claims add the construction of *occurrence nodes* and *logical occurrence nodes*, storage of product data in those nodes, and the creation of mappings between CAD designs, manufacturing assembly sequences and different design domains.\n\n3. Determine the technical problem solved by the invention: to provide a unified method that links product design (CAD) and manufacturing (CAM) through a hierarchical data model that captures both physical component usages and logical usage information, thereby enabling automatic selection, configuration and cross‑domain mapping of product data.\n\n4. Assess whether the prior art discloses or renders obvious each distinguishing feature:\n   - The GBOM paper teaches a logical representation of component relationships using matrices, but it does **not** disclose a hierarchical data model that includes separate \"component‑usages\" and \"logical component‑usages\" linked to a parent assembly, nor does it address CAD/CAM integration.\n   - The paper does not teach the creation of occurrence nodes or logical occurrence nodes, nor the storage of product data in such nodes.\n   - No teaching is found for mapping CAD designs or manufacturing assembly sequences to the product data‑model, nor for mapping between different design domains of a product family.\n\n5. Consider whether a skilled person, starting from the GBOM disclosure, would find it obvious to arrive at the claimed method by combining common knowledge of CAD/CAM data structures. While CAD/CAM data models are known, the specific hierarchical linking of logical component‑usages with component‑usages, the definition of occurrence nodes, and the systematic cross‑domain mappings are not suggested or motivated by the prior art. The combination would require a non‑trivial re‑structuring of the GBOM concept and the definition of new data‑structures (occurrence nodes, logical occurrence nodes) that go beyond the matrix‑based representation.\n\n6. Conclusion: The claimed invention contains technical features that are not directly disclosed nor rendered obvious by the closest prior art. Therefore, the invention involves an inventive step under Article 56 EPC.\n\nAnswer: Yes",

  "reasoning": "1. Identify the closest prior art: the academic paper on an ink‑annotation architecture for web documents. It discloses using DHTML/W3C DOM to capture pen‑based ink, associate the ink with DOM nodes, and store/retrieve the ink.\n2. Compare claim 1 with the disclosure of the prior art. The claim requires:\n   - receiving *simultaneous touch* input signals from a touch‑sensitive device,\n   - each signal being linked to a different DOM node (region of the web page),\n   - determining separate touch events (start, move, end, cancel),\n   - detecting a *gesture* by combining those separate touch events, and\n   - sending the resulting gesture event to the web page for processing (e.g., via HTML/JavaScript attributes).\n3. The prior art deals exclusively with *pen* (ink) input, not with *touch* input, and it does not disclose handling of multiple simultaneous input points, nor the concept of combining separate touch events into a higher‑level gesture event.\n4. The distinguishing features (simultaneous multi‑touch, separate touch events per DOM node, gesture detection by combining them, and forwarding the gesture as a web‑page event) are therefore not taught or suggested by the ink‑annotation paper.\n5. Assess obviousness: while multi‑touch handling is known in the broader field of mobile operating systems, the prior art provides no teaching, motivation or suggestion to apply such multi‑touch techniques to a DOM‑based web‑page environment in the manner claimed. The skilled person would have to combine unrelated teachings (pen‑based ink annotation + generic multi‑touch handling) without any indication that such a combination solves a technical problem in the context of web pages. Under the EPO problem‑solution approach, the objective technical problem (enabling multi‑touch gesture interaction with web‑page elements) would not be rendered obvious by the cited paper.\n6.

The core technical features are:\\n- A turbo encoder producing systematic and parity bits;\\n- Separate rate‑matching of systematic and parity bits;\\n- Two separate interleavers (first for systematic bits, second for parity bits) that write bits row‑by‑row from first to last row;\\n- An inter‑column permutation performed on each interleaver according to a determined rule;\\n- The modulator alternately collects bits column‑by‑column from the two interleavers and maps them onto one modulation symbol (e.g., for 16QAM, 2 bits from each interleaver per symbol);\\n- The sizes of the two interleavers are identical;\\n- Optional handling when the numbers of systematic and parity bits differ (padding in the appropriate interleaver);\\n- Corresponding receiving apparatus/method with de‑interleavers that write bits column‑by‑column and perform the inverse permutation.\\n\\nStep 3: Compare the prior art with the claim. The prior art mentions:\\n- Two parallel data streams per TTI;\\n- Flexible bit mapping according to MCS and code‑rate;\\n- Soft‑combining of retransmissions;\\n- No explicit disclosure of a turbo encoder, separate systematic/parity interleavers, row‑wise writing, inter‑column permutation, or the alternating column‑by‑column collection for modulation.\\nThus the prior art does not disclose the specific interleaver architecture nor the precise way bits are collected and mapped to modulation symbols.\\n\\nStep 4: Assess technical effect of the distinguishing features. The claimed arrangement provides a deterministic, regular mapping of systematic and parity bits onto modulation symbols, which can improve decoder performance (e.g., better soft‑information distribution) and simplify hardware implementation because the two interleavers have identical size and the column‑wise alternating collection matches the symbol‑wise mapping of QAM constellations. This technical effect is not taught or suggested by the prior art.\\n\\nStep 5: Determine obviousness. A skilled person in the field of wireless communications would be aware of separate systematic/parity streams in turbo coding and of interleaving for error‑performance improvement. However, the prior art does not suggest the particular combination of (i) writing rows first, (ii) performing a deterministic inter‑column permutation, (iii) alternating column‑wise collection for modulation, and (iv) identical‑size dual interleavers with the padding rules. While each individual element might be known, their specific combination and the resulting regular mapping to QAM symbols is not disclosed nor would it be directly derivable from the teaching of the prior art. Consequently, the skilled person would not find the claimed solution obvious.\\n\\nStep 6: Conclusion. The claimed invention contains technical features that are not disclosed in the closest prior art and are not obvious to a person skilled in the art.

The claim further specifies that the temperature feedback voltage is generated by a first operational amplifier (U1) and the current feedback voltage by a second operational amplifier (U2).\n\n3.

Extract the distinguishing features of claim 1 of the patent in suit:\n   a. The hybrid storage is managed by a **log‑structured file system**.\n   b. The LFS implements **two different data‑layout formats**: a *first* format for SSDs (write‑anywhere) and a *second* format for HDDs (sequential, region‑based with contiguous block numbers).\n   c.

The SSDs use a write‑anywhere technique; the HDDs use a sequential‑write (streaming) technique.\n\n3. Technical effect of the distinguishing features (as described in the patent):\n   - Aligns the storage‑media characteristics with the file‑system layout, yielding higher random‑write performance on SSDs and higher sequential‑write throughput on HDDs.\n   - Reduces write amplification and wear on SSDs by using LFS‑based wear‑levelling (although wear‑levelling is in dependent claims, the core claim already benefits from the LFS layout).\n   - Enables efficient block‑level migration without manual intervention.\n\n4.

A *solvated compressed protein matrix material* obtained by (i) preparing a composition of one or more biocompatible proteins and solvents, (ii) partially drying the composition to a solvent content of 20 %–80 %, (iii) forming a non‑brittle cohesive body, and (iv) compressing that body at a pressure of 689 kPa to 689 500 kPa (100 psi to 100 000 psi) for 2 s to 48 h, resulting in a final solvent content of 10 %–60 %.\n2. The method includes a coating step to form a film before the partial‑drying and compression steps.\n3.

It never discloses a step of *high‑pressure compression* of a partially dried protein body.\n- The pressure range (up to 100 000 psi) and the aim of retaining a significant amount of solvent (10 %–60 %) after compression are not taught. Known protein tablet technologies aim at *dry* tablets; retaining solvent at such high pressures would be unexpected because solvent would normally be expelled.\n- The combination of (a) partial drying to a specific solvent window, (b) subsequent high‑pressure compression while still solvated, and (c) optional cross‑linking/imprinting to obtain a cohesive, non‑brittle matrix is not suggested anywhere in the cited document.\n- The prior art does not provide any motivation or teaching to achieve a *solvated* compressed matrix; its teaching is centred on layered films where the solvent is removed to obtain a stable film.\n\n**Step 4 – Consider the skilled person’s perspective**\nA skilled person reading the prior art would understand how to make collagen films and how to incorporate drugs, plasticisers, etc. However, there is no indication that compressing a partially dried protein film at very high pressure to obtain a *solvated* matrix would be beneficial or even feasible.

TITLE: Representing the relationship between items in logical
bill-of-material to support customers’ request for quotation for
make-to-order products

TYPE: Academic Paper

ABSTRACT: 

For make-to-order products in which the specification of some component-product variants are to be defined by
customers, it is almost impossible to develop a bill-of-material system that support customers’ requests for quotation
(RFQ) response activities usingthe existingbill-of-material concepts. To deal with this problem, a new technique
for representingthe relationship between parent-product variants and component-product variants in the generic
bill-of-material (GBOM) structure is developed. The new technique is based on an assumption that the relationship
between any two components in a product structure has pairwise independent property. The technique represents the
relationship with compatibility constraints in the form of matrices and rules. The new representation provides users
with a means to describingvariants of make-to-order products as well as supportingthe customers’ RFQ response
activities with only a limited amount of data which is comprehensive, easy to maintain, and easy to understand.

TITLE: Adaptive HARQ for fixed TTI using soft acknowledgement

TYPE: Working Group Document

DOCUMENT:

We showed a physical layer structure and coding scheme that combines the advantages of the conventional fixed 
and variable TTI proposals by allowing to use two parallel data streams for each TTI. The main benefits are: 
• flexible mapping of required retransmission energy using MCS level and code rate adaptation, as 
well as bit mapping, 
• reduced interference, 
• allows soft-combining of retransmissions at different MCS levels,
• high frame fill efficiency, 
• increased throughput, 
• maintains simplicity of fixed TTI. 
The concepts presented in this paper are suitable for incremental redundancy, but can also be adapted to Chase 
combining.

TITLE: Design and implementation of a wireless internet remote access platform

TYPE: Academic Paper

ABSTRACT:

Recently, mobile networks and internet technologies have been widely developed for the voice communication and information retrieval services all over the world. Compared with the wire-line internet environment, mobile networks have lower bandwidth, longer transmission latency and unreliable connection, and the capability of mobile terminals is restricted by the limited memory size, lower CPU computation capability and inconvenient I/O interface. These limitations restrict the development of the wireless internet applications. In this paper, we design and implement a ‘wireless internet remote access platform’ (WIRAP). The WIRAP platform interconnects the wireless network and internet to provide mobile users a remote centralized storage and computation environment. A mobile user can store large volume of data and execute complex computations on WIRAP instead of on the mobile terminals. WIRAP supports different network interfaces (e.g. short message service (SMS), wireless markup language (WML) and hyper text markup language (HTML) and users may use terminals (with different network capabilities) to access WIRAP.

DOCUMENT DESCRIPTION:

In accordance with the analysis of the content of D5 in case T 1983/09 the Board considers that document D5 discloses a system for supplying power to an LED load (cf. column 5, line 51 and figure 8) e.g. traffic lights (cf. column 4, lines 33 and 34), the system comprising:

a LED driver module (comparator and transistor T) operable to regulate a flow of a LED current ILED through the LED load as a function of a temperature-dependent feedback signal UREG (cf. figure 8 and column 7, lines 13 to 27); and

a current controller module (Regulator) in electric communication with said LED driver module to communicate the temperature-dependent feedback signal UREG to said LED driver module.

The current controller module is operable to generate a temperature-dependent feedback signal UREG in response to an operating temperature (signal input to the adder connected to the inverting input of the regulator) and the flow of the LED current through the LED load (signal at the non-inverting input of the regulator). The current controller module includes means for generating a temperature feedback signal as a function of a sensed operating temperature of the LED load (see column 4, lines 18 to 21 and column 7, lines 13 to 16 and figure 8: NTC and temperature regulation module) and means for generating a current feedback signal as a function of a sensed flow of the LED current ILED through the LED load (cf. column 2, lines 57 to 62). The current feedback signal is a current feedback voltage (output of the integrator is necessarily a voltage since it is applied to an input of an operational amplifier used as a regulator).

The system further comprises means for mixing the temperature feedback signal and the current feedback voltage (see figure 8: adder at the input of the regulator and the regulator drawn as an operational amplifier) to yield a temperature and current-dependent feedback voltage UREG.

TITLE: An architecture for ink annotations on Web documents

TYPE: Academic Paper

ABSTRACT:

There have been recent improvements in document technologies like the standardization of object interfaces to access and manipulate the properties of Web documents. There has also been significant progress in pen based computing for recognition of digital ink in desktops, tablets and handheld devices. These have necessitated a need for further research on annotation architectures for digital documents, specifically pen-based annotation systems. This paper presents an attempt to leverage the new standards of DHTML and W3C DOM that are being gradually implemented by popular browsers, to build a prototype of an ink annotation system with common components across browsers. One of the primary goals in this study is to semantically link ink data with underlying document elements like text and images. The system has three components: a) ink capture and rendering b) Ink Understanding, which recognizes and associates ink with the underlying document; and c) Ink storage and retrieval.

{
  "reasoning": "Step 1: Identify the claimed subject‑matter. The claims concern (i) a specific crystalline form of the compound (3R)-1-(2‑methylalanyl‑D‑tryptophyl)-3‑(phenylmethyl)-3‑piperidinecarboxylic acid 1,2,2‑trimethylhydrazide, including its anhydrous and hydrate (dihydrate) forms; (ii) a defined X‑ray powder diffraction pattern; (iii) a process for preparing the crystals using methanol/water solvents under defined temperature and cooling conditions; (iv) pharmaceutical compositions containing the crystal; and (v) a therapeutic use for stimulating growth‑hormone release.\n\nStep 2: Identify the closest prior art supplied. The only document provided is a US patent on a method for storing and managing data elements with tags in a hierarchical structure – a computer‑software invention. It contains no chemical teaching, no mention of the claimed compound, its crystal forms, preparation methods, or pharmaceutical use.\n\nStep 3: Determine the technical differences. The prior art does not disclose any of the following: the specific chemical structure, its stereochemistry, the crystalline polymorphs (anhydrous, hydrate, dihydrate), the diffraction pattern, the solvent‑based crystallisation process, nor any pharmaceutical application. Hence the claimed invention is completely distinct from the teaching of the prior art.\n\nStep 4: Assess obviousness. Under Article 56 EPC, a claim lacks inventive step only if the skilled person, starting from the closest prior art, would find the claimed subject‑matter obvious in view of the teaching of that document together with common general knowledge. The data‑management patent provides no guidance on organic synthesis, crystallisation, polymorphism, or pharmaceutical formulation. There is no reason for the skilled chemist to modify a software method to arrive at a new crystalline peptide‑like hydrazide. Consequently, the claimed invention would not have been obvious to a person skilled in the art.\n\nStep 5: Conclusion. Because the closest prior art is unrelated and does not render the claimed crystalline compound, its preparation process, or its use obvious, the invention satisfies the EPO requirement of an inventive step.\n\nAnswer: Yes",

[LLM RESPONSE]:
{
  "reasoning": "1. Identify the closest prior art: the product information listing numerous DBM (demineralized bone matrix) products (putties, gels, sheets, cylindrical plugs, etc.).\n2. Determine the distinguishing features of claim 1 over this prior art:\n   - A tubular covering that includes a poly(glycolic acid) (PGA) mesh.\n   - The covering incorporates a physical attachment mechanism (wrap, suture, wire, cable, etc.).\n   - The covering defines a first compartment that contains a mixture of surface demineralized bone chips and demineralized bone fibers.\n   - The covering is designed to retain the substance for placement at a surgical site and to facilitate transfer of the substance (or surrounding material) actively or passively upon implantation.\n   - Optional features such as subdivision into smaller compartments, seals, tension bands, etc.\n3. Check whether any of these features are disclosed in the prior art. The prior‑art documents only describe DBM in various carriers (putty, gel, sheet, cylindrical plugs) and do not disclose a tubular delivery system, a PGA mesh, or an attachment mechanism integrated into a covering.\n4. Assess obviousness: Even if PGA mesh and attachment mechanisms are known in other contexts, the prior art does not provide any teaching or suggestion to combine them with a DBM mixture into a tubular, compartmentalised delivery system. No motivation to achieve the specific functional result (retaining the substance and enabling active/passive transfer upon degradation) is present in the provided documents.\n5. Apply the EPO problem‑solution approach: The technical problem is to provide a delivery system that securely holds a DBM mixture and can be fixed to tissue during surgery. The solution – a PGA‑mesh tubular covering with an attachment mechanism – is not directly suggested by the closest prior art, and the skilled person would not arrive at it in an obvious manner.\n6.

List the distinguishing features of claim 1 (the method):   \n   a) Receiving a user instruction to attach a file while composing an e‑mail on a handheld device.   \n   b) Requesting a file‑browsing service on a separate file‑delivery server and presenting the file list on the handheld UI.   \n   c) Prompting for and furnishing file‑access credentials to the browsing service.   \n   d) Sending, together with the e‑mail, an *attachment instruction* that contains the identifier of the selected file **and** the access credentials.   \n   e) A mail agent that, upon receiving the attachment instruction, retrieves the file directly from the file‑delivery server using the supplied credentials and assembles the complete e‑mail.\n4. Determine whether each distinguishing feature is directly and unambiguously disclosed in the prior art: none of the above features are taught or suggested by WIRAP. The paper only talks about remote storage and computation; it does not mention e‑mail composition, MIME types, attachment instructions, or a mail agent that pulls the file from the server on behalf of the handheld device.\n5. Assess obviousness: For a combination to be obvious, the prior art must provide a teaching, suggestion or motivation to modify the known system in the way claimed. While a skilled person would know that handheld devices can send e‑mail and that remote storage can be accessed, the prior art gives no indication that the file should be attached **without** first downloading it to the handheld, nor that the credentials should be passed to a mail agent to retrieve the file. The specific technical problem solved – enabling attachment of a remote file to an e‑mail without transferring the file to the handheld – is not addressed in the prior art, and there is no reason for the skilled person to arrive at the claimed solution in an obvious manner.\n6. Conclusion under Article 56 EPC: The claimed method contains technical features that are not directly and unambiguously disclosed in the closest prior art, and the combination of known elements does not yield the claimed invention in an obvious way.

  "reasoning": "1. Identify the closest prior art: an academic paper describing an architecture for ink annotations on web documents. The paper teaches capturing pen‑based ink, linking the ink to DOM elements, and storing/retrieving the ink. 2. Extract the teaching of the prior art: (a) use of the W3C DOM to access web‑page elements, (b) capture of a single input stream (ink) associated with a single document element, (c) no mention of touch input, simultaneous inputs, or gesture detection. 3. Compare claim 1 with the prior art. Claim 1 requires: (i) receiving *simultaneous* touch input signals from *two or more* regions of a web page, each region linked to a different DOM node; (ii) determining separate touch events for each region; (iii) *combining* those separate events to detect a *gesture* event; (iv) sending that gesture event to the web page for processing. 4. Identify the technical differences: – Use of touch rather than pen/ink. – Handling of *multiple* concurrent inputs from distinct DOM nodes. – Creation of a higher‑level “gesture” by merging separate touch events. – Transmission of the gesture event to the web page (e.g., via HTML/JavaScript attributes). 5. Assess the technical effect of the differences: they enable multi‑touch interactions that involve distinct parts of a web page, allowing richer user interfaces (e.g., dragging two separate elements together, performing a combined action). This effect is not achieved by the ink‑annotation system. 6. Determine whether the differences would have been obvious to the skilled person. The prior art teaches linking a single input stream to a DOM element; it does not teach handling *simultaneous* inputs from *different* elements nor the notion of merging those inputs into a single gesture event. While touch input and multi‑touch gestures are known in the art, the specific combination of (a) mapping each concurrent touch to a distinct DOM node, (b) detecting a combined gesture, and (c) delivering that gesture to the web page via markup attributes is not disclosed or suggested by the ink‑annotation teaching.

  "reasoning": "1. Identify the closest prior art (the academic paper) and its teaching. The paper discloses a \"generic bill‑of‑material\" (GBOM) that represents relationships between parent‑product variants and component‑product variants using compatibility matrices and rules.

The disclosure is limited to a logical representation of product structure and does not address CAD/CAM integration, occurrence‑node structures, or mappings to design and manufacturing sequences.\n\n2. Extract the distinguishing features of the claimed method (claims 1‑10). The core distinguishing features are:\n   - A product data‑model stored in computer memory that hierarchically interconnects a parent assembly, component‑usages and *logical* component‑usages.\n   - Use of *logical component‑usages* to select or identify roles of component‑usages in an assembly configuration.\n   - Construction of *occurrence nodes* and *logical occurrence nodes* that correspond to paths in the product data‑model and store product data.\n   - Association of part‑interfaces and part‑usages with these nodes, and creation of mappings between CAD designs, manufacturing assembly sequences and the product data‑model.\n   - Mapping across different design domains (e.g., from one design aspect of a product family to another).\n\n3. Compare each distinguishing feature with the prior art.\n   - The prior art teaches a logical representation of component relationships, but it does not teach a hierarchical structure that includes separate \"component‑usages\" and \"logical component‑usages\" linked in the way claimed.\n   - The prior art does not disclose the notion of *occurrence nodes* or *logical occurrence nodes* that store product data and represent paths through the model.\n   - The prior art is silent on any integration with CAD (design) or CAM (manufacturing) data, nor on mapping CAD designs or manufacturing assembly sequences to the product data‑model.\n   - The prior art does not address cross‑domain mappings between different design aspects of a product family.\n\n4. Assess whether the distinguishing features would have been obvious to the skilled person. A skilled person in computer‑aided design/manufacturing data management would be aware of logical BOM concepts (as taught by the prior art) but would not be prompted by the paper to create the specific hierarchical model with separate logical component‑usages, to introduce occurrence nodes, or to implement the detailed CAD/CAM mapping steps. These features require a non‑trivial technical contribution: defining new data structures (occurrence nodes), establishing bidirectional mappings between design and manufacturing artefacts, and extending the logical BOM idea to support multi‑domain product families. No teaching or suggestion in the prior art points to these specific implementations.\n\n5. Conclusion on inventive step. Because the claimed method contains multiple technical features that are not disclosed or suggested by the closest prior art, and because the combination of these features would not have been obvious to a person skilled in the art, the invention meets the requirement of an inventive step under Article 56 EPC.\n\nAnswer: Yes, the claimed invention satisfies the inventive‑step requirement.",

Compare claim 1 with D5.\n   - Both claims define a LED driver module and a current controller module that communicate a feedback signal to the driver.\n   - Both generate a temperature feedback signal from a sensed temperature and a current feedback signal from a sensed LED current.\n   - Both mix the two feedback signals to obtain a temperature‑and‑current‑dependent feedback voltage.\n   - The only structural difference in claim 1 is the explicit mention of two separate operational amplifiers (U1 and U2) to generate the temperature and current feedback voltages. D5 already uses operational amplifiers (the regulator and the integrator) to perform analogous functions, and a skilled person would readily implement the two feedback paths with two op‑amps.\n3. Assess whether the difference (use of two distinct op‑amps) would have been obvious.\n   - The skilled person, knowing D5, would understand that the temperature and current feedback signals must be conditioned before being summed. Implementing each conditioning block with a dedicated op‑amp is a routine design choice in analog circuitry.\n   - No teaching or suggestion in the prior art is required to replace the integrator or the temperature‑regulation block with a dedicated op‑amp; such substitution is routine and would be obvious.\n4. Since claim 1 lacks any further technical contribution over D5, it does not involve an inventive step. Dependent claims (fault detection, fusistor, etc.) depend on claim 1; the lack of inventive step in the main request means the overall invention does not meet the requirement.\n5. Conclusion: The claimed invention is obvious in view of D5 and therefore does not satisfy the inventive‑step requirement of the EPC.",

  "reasoning": "1. Identify the closest prior art: the Working Group Document titled “Adaptive HARQ for fixed TTI using soft acknowledgement”. It discloses a physical‑layer structure with two parallel data streams, flexible mapping of bits to modulation symbols, and support for incremental redundancy or Chase combining.\\n\\n2. Determine the distinguishing features of the claimed invention (main request, claims 1‑5, 6‑10, 11‑16). The key technical features not found in the prior art are:\\n   - Separate interleavers for systematic bits and parity bits, each written row‑by‑row from first to last row.\\n   - After row‑wise writing, an inter‑column permutation (a deterministic rule) is applied independently to the two interleavers.\\n   - The modulator (or demodulator) alternately collects bits column‑by‑column from the two interleavers and maps a fixed number of bits from each (e.g., 2 systematic + 2 parity bits for 16‑QAM) onto a single modulation symbol.\\n   - The two interleavers have identical size and operate in parallel.\\n   - Specific handling when the number of systematic bits differs from the number of parity bits (claims 2,3,12,13).\\n\\n3. Compare with the prior art: the document mentions \"two parallel data streams\" and \"flexible mapping of required retransmission energy using MCS level and code rate adaptation, as well as bit mapping\". It does not disclose:\\n   - the use of two distinct interleavers dedicated to systematic and parity bits;\\n   - the row‑wise writing followed by a column‑wise permutation;\\n   - the alternating column‑by‑column collection for modulation;\\n   - the equal‑size parallel interleavers;\\n   - the specific rule for handling unequal numbers of systematic/parity bits.\\n\\n4. Assess whether the distinguishing features would be obvious to the skilled person. The skilled person, starting from the prior art, knows that parallel streams can be used and that bits can be mapped flexibly to modulation symbols. However, the prior art provides no teaching or suggestion to separate systematic and parity bits into two identical interleavers, to organise them row‑wise and then permute columns, nor to alternate the collection of bits from the two interleavers for each modulation symbol. Implementing such a structure requires a concrete architectural decision that is not derivable from the generic teaching of \"flexible bit mapping\". Moreover, the handling of unequal numbers of systematic and parity bits (claims 2,3,12,13) is a further technical refinement not hinted at in the prior art. Consequently, the skilled person would not arrive at the claimed arrangement in an obvious manner.\\n\\n5. Conclusion: The claimed apparatus and method contain technical features that are not disclosed or suggested by the closest prior art and are not obvious to the person skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention satisfies the requirement of an inventive step under Article 56 EPC.",

  "reasoning": "1. Identify the closest prior art: the US patent titled “Software Product Authentication” discloses a system where a terminal creates a first key that is used to generate an authentication code printed on a document (e.g., a lottery ticket) and a second key that is transmitted to and stored on a central server. The server later verifies the printed authentication code by using the stored second key.\n2. Compare claim 1 with the prior art:\n   - Both disclose providing a ticket with a code printed on it (validation code vs. authentication code).\n   - Both disclose generating a code at the time of ticket creation using an algorithm (first key/first encryption code vs. first key → authentication code).\n   - Both disclose storing a value on a central server (second key vs. first encryption code).\n   - Both disclose later receiving a code from the ticket holder and verifying it by applying the same algorithm and comparing with the stored value.\n3. Differences of the claim:\n   - The claim uses a single algorithm (e.g., MD5) applied twice to the same validation code, producing identical “first” and “second” encryption codes, rather than a pair of asymmetric keys.\n   - The claim introduces a “second‑chance or end‑of‑game drawing” and a second record that stores only those codes that have been verified as eligible for that drawing.\n   - Additional optional features (website submission, lock‑out after three failed attempts, removable coating, etc.) are dependent claims.\n4. Assessment of obviousness:\n   - Using a hash function (MD5) to generate a reproducible code from a ticket‑borne value and to verify it later is a well‑known technique in computer security and is directly taught by the prior art’s use of a first key to generate an authentication code and a second key to verify it.\n   - The idea of storing the generated code centrally and later comparing a submitted code with the stored value is explicitly disclosed in the prior art.\n   - Adapting this known authentication mechanism to a lottery’s second‑chance drawing is a straightforward application of a known technical solution to a known business problem in the lottery field. The skilled person would readily recognise that the same verification infrastructure could be reused to decide eligibility for a subsequent drawing.\n   - No technical teaching in the prior art suggests the specific step of creating a separate “second record” that contains only verified codes for a later drawing, but creating such a filtered list from already verified entries is an obvious data‑management step once the verification mechanism is in place.\n5. Conclusion: The distinguishing features of claim 1 over the closest prior art are either generic data‑processing steps or a routine business‑model adaptation that would have been obvious to a person skilled in the art. Therefore, the claimed invention does not involve an inventive step under Article 56 EPC.\n\nAnswer: No",

  "reasoning": "1. Identify the closest prior art: the US patent titled “Dual media storage device”. It discloses a system with two non‑volatile storage devices (a fast, low‑capacity flash device and a slower, high‑capacity magnetic device) and a storage controller that directs incoming data to one device or the other, optionally copies data from the fast device to the slow device, and may use overlapping logical address spaces.  \n2. Compare the features of claim 1 with the prior art.  \n   - Claim 1 requires a **log‑structured file system (LFS)** that implements two distinct data‑layout formats: a “write‑anywhere” format for SSDs and a “sequential‑write/region‑based” format for HDDs.  \n   - The prior art does **not** disclose any LFS, nor any notion of separate layout formats per media, nor the concepts of “write‑anywhere” versus “sequential‑write” techniques.  \n   - Migration in claim 1 is performed by **identifying related file data, copying it into the LFS log, and then storing it on the HDD according to the second layout format using contiguous regions of block numbers**.  The prior art merely mentions copying data from the fast device to the slow device; it does not describe a log‑based migration, region‑based placement, or block‑number continuity.  \n   - Additional features (heuristics and policies for automatic block‑level migration, RAID module integration, SSD controller geometry export, wear‑levelling logic, and explicit block‑granularity movement) are also absent from the prior art.  \n3. Determine the technical contribution of the distinguishing features.  \n   - The LFS provides a unified management layer that can simultaneously exploit the random‑write strength of SSDs (write‑anywhere) and the sequential‑write efficiency of HDDs (region‑based streaming).  \n   - The region‑based layout on HDDs and the log‑based migration mechanism solve the problem of efficiently moving related file blocks between heterogeneous media without manual intervention.  \n   - The combination of these mechanisms with RAID and SSD geometry export yields a hybrid storage system that achieves higher performance and reliability than the simple cache‑or‑copy schemes of the prior art.  \n4. Assess obviousness to the skilled person.  \n   - While the skilled person would recognise that SSDs are better suited to random writes and HDDs to sequential writes, the prior art provides no teaching or suggestion to employ a **log‑structured file system** that simultaneously governs both media with two distinct layout formats.  \n   - Implementing a log‑structured file system for SSDs is known, and using sequential layout for HDDs is known, but their **combined, coordinated use**—including the specific migration steps via a log, region‑based placement, and automatic heuristics—requires more than routine optimisation.  \n   - The prior art’s teaching is limited to directing data or copying data; it does not hint at the structural re‑organisation of the file system itself.  Consequently, the skilled person would not arrive at the claimed solution in an obvious manner.  \n5. Conclusion under Article 56 EPC: the claimed invention contains technical features that are not disclosed or rendered obvious by the closest prior art. Therefore, the invention satisfies the requirement of an inventive step.\n\nAnswer: Yes",

  "reasoning": "1. **Identify the closest prior art** – The US patent on multi‑layered collagen films (US‑patent) is the most relevant document. It discloses collagen films (single or multilayer) containing active ingredients, with optional plasticisers, stabilisers, drying enhancers, etc. The films are prepared by casting/stacking layers and drying to a solid film. No teaching of compression of the film or of a partially dried, solvent‑containing cohesive body is disclosed.\n\n2. **Determine the distinguishing features of the claimed invention** – Claim 1 (and the dependent claims) define a *solvated compressed protein matrix material* that is obtained by:\n   - mixing one or more biocompatible proteins with a biocompatible solvent,\n   - partially drying the mixture to a solvent content of 20‑80 % to obtain a non‑brittle cohesive body,\n   - compressing this body at a pressure of 689 kPa to 689 500 kPa for 2 s to 48 h, thereby reducing the bulk solvent to a final solvent content of 10‑60 %.\n   Additional features (cross‑linking, inclusion of polymers, drugs, multilayer structures, etc.) are further dependent claims.\n\n3. **Assess whether the distinguishing features are disclosed or suggested by the prior art** – The prior art teaches:\n   - collagen films (solid, dry or partially dry),\n   - layering of drug‑reservoir and rate‑controlling layers,\n   - inclusion of plasticisers, stabilisers, buffers, etc.\n   It does **not** disclose:\n   - the step of compressing a partially dried protein/solvent body at high pressure,\n   - the specific solvent‑content ranges before and after compression,\n   - the use of a broad spectrum of proteins (elastin, silk, keratin, etc.) beyond collagen,\n   - the concept of a *solvated* compressed matrix that retains a defined amount of solvent after compression.\n\n4. **Consider the motivation of the skilled person** – A skilled person in the field of protein‑based drug delivery would be aware of conventional film‑casting techniques and of standard tablet‑pressing methods for dry powders. However, the prior art provides no teaching or motivation to combine a *wet, partially dried* protein body with high‑pressure compression in order to obtain a *solvated* matrix. The high pressures (up to 689 500 kPa) and the need to retain a specific solvent content are not obvious from the teaching of merely drying and stacking collagen layers. Moreover, the risk of protein denaturation under such pressures would have discouraged a routine trial without a specific teaching.\n\n5. **Apply the problem‑solution approach** –\n   - *Closest prior art*: multi‑layered collagen film (US‑patent).\n   - *Technical problem*: provide a protein‑based drug‑delivery matrix that can be produced in a compact, shape‑retaining form while still containing a controlled amount of solvent to improve handling and drug release.\n   - *Solution*: the claimed method of partial drying followed by high‑pressure compression to obtain a solvated compressed matrix.\n   - *Obviousness*: The solution is not directly derivable from the prior art. The prior art does not suggest compressing a wet protein body, nor does it provide any teaching on the specific pressure/solvent‑content parameters. Consequently, the skilled person would not arrive at the claimed matrix in an obvious manner.\n\n6. **Conclusion** – The claimed invention involves technical features that are not disclosed, nor rendered obvious, by the closest prior art. Therefore, the requirement of an inventive step (Article 56 EPC) is fulfilled.\n\n**Answer**: Yes, the claimed invention satisfies the inventive‑step requirement.",
