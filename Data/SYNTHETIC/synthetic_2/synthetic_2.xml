<abstract id="abst" lang="en">
<p id="pa01" num="0001">A weather protection device is disclosed comprising a standard umbrella structure with a canopy, a central shaft, and a handle. The device is characterised by the integration of an electric lighting means, such as an LED torch, directly into the handle of the umbrella. This configuration allows a user to hold the umbrella for protection against rain while simultaneously illuminating the path ahead, eliminating the need to carry a separate flashlight. The lighting means is powered by removable batteries located within the handle cavity.</p>

<description id="desc" lang="en">
<heading id="h0001"><b>Field of the Invention</b></heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to personal weather protection accessories, specifically umbrellas, and portable lighting devices. More particularly, the invention relates to an umbrella combined with a light source.</p>
<heading id="h0002"><b>Background of the Invention</b></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">Umbrellas are widely used for protection against precipitation. A standard umbrella comprises a collapsible canopy supported by ribs, a central shaft, and a handle at the distal end of the shaft. It is also common for individuals to walk outdoors during hours of darkness. When it is raining at night, visibility is reduced due to low light conditions and the obstruction caused by the rain itself.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">To navigate safely in the dark, pedestrians often use portable flashlights (torches) or the flashlight function of a mobile phone. However, holding an umbrella in one hand and a flashlight in the other hand is inconvenient. It occupies both of the user's hands, making it difficult to perform other tasks such as opening doors, carrying bags, or operating a mobile phone. Furthermore, if the user does not have a flashlight, they risk tripping over obstacles or stepping into puddles.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Existing solutions typically involve carrying a separate light source, which does not solve the problem of encumbrance.</p>
<heading id="h0003"><b>Summary of the Invention</b></heading>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">The objective of the present invention is to solve the problem of requiring two hands to hold both an umbrella and a light source. The invention solves this by physically combining the two devices.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">According to the invention, there is provided an umbrella comprising a canopy, a shaft, and a handle, characterised in that the handle comprises an integrated light source configured to emit light. By integrating the light into the handle, the user can protect themselves from rain and illuminate their path using only one hand.</p>
<heading id="h0004"><b>Brief Description of the Drawings</b></heading>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings:
<dl id="dl0001">
<dt>Fig. 1</dt><dd>shows a side view of the umbrella with the integrated light source in the handle.</dd>
<dt>Fig. 2</dt><dd>shows a cross-section of the handle showing the battery compartment and LED.</dd>
</dl>
</p>
<heading id="h0005"><b>Detailed Description of the Invention</b></heading>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">Referring to Fig. 1, the device comprises a conventional umbrella assembly 10 including a waterproof fabric canopy 12 supported by a plurality of ribs 14. The ribs are pivotally connected to a central shaft 16. At the lower end of the shaft 16, a handle 18 is provided for the user to grip.</p>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">The handle 18 is constructed from a rigid material such as plastic or wood. Embedded within the distal end of the handle 18 is a light source 20. In the preferred embodiment, the light source 20 is a Light Emitting Diode (LED) assembly. The LED is oriented to direct a beam of light downwardly and outwardly from the bottom of the handle, thereby illuminating the ground in front of the user when the umbrella is held in a vertical or semi-vertical position.</p>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">Referring to Fig. 2, the handle 18 is hollow and defines an internal cavity 22. This cavity houses a power source 24, which comprises two AA batteries connected in series. A switch 26 is mounted on the external surface of the handle 18. The switch 26 is electrically connected between the power source 24 and the light source 20, allowing the user to selectively activate or deactivate the light.</p>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">This combination of features allows a single device to perform the functions of both prior art devices (the umbrella and the flashlight) without any modification to the principle of operation of either component. The umbrella protects from rain in the known manner, and the light illuminates the dark in the known manner.</p>
