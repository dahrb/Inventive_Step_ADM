MAIN REQUEST

What is claimed is:

1. A method for processing touches comprising:

receiving (302) simultaneous touch input signals associated with two
or more regions of a web page (100) displayed on a touch sensitive device
(400), wherein each region is associated with a different respective node (152-
160) in a document object model (150);

determining (304) two or more separate touch events associated with
the two or more regions of the web page based on the touch input signals;

detecting a gesture event by combining the two or more separate touch
events associated with the two or more regions of the web page; and

sending the gesture event to the web page for processing.

2. The method of claim 1, wherein the touch events are from a group of
touch events consisting of a touch start event, a touch move event, a touch

end event and a touch cancel event.

3. The method of claim 1, wherein a sequence of touch events are
determined including a start touch event, one or more touch move events and

a touch end or touch cancel event.

4. The method of claim 1, wherein two or more touch events are

determined to be a touch gesture.

5. The method of claim 1, wherein the touch events occur at substantially

the same time.

6. The method of claim 1, wherein the web page regions are associated
with nodes in the document object model and the nodes are at the same or

different hierarchical levels of the document object model.

26
7. The method of claim 1, wherein the web page corresponds to a markup
language document with attributes that define event actions and that are

associated with the gesture event.

8. The method of claim 7, wherein the event actions include running

JavaScript.

9. The method of claim 1, wherein the web page corresponds to an HTML
document with attributes in one or more HTML tags that define event actions

and that are associated with the gesture event.

10. The method of claim 1, wherein each touch event is associated with a

single touch input signal.

11. The method of claim 10, wherein each touch input signal is generated
in response to touch input generated by a single finger touching the touch

sensitive device.

12. A computer-readable medium having instructions stored thereon,
which, when executed by at least one processor (604), cause the at least one
processor to perform operations comprising:

receiving (302) simultaneous touch input signals associated with two
or more regions of a web page displayed on a touch sensitive device, wherein
each region is associated with a different respective node in a document object
model;

determining (304) two or more separate touch events associated with
the two or more regions of the web page based on the touch input signals;

detecting a gesture event by combining the two or more separate touch
events associated with the two or more regions of the web page; and

sending the gesture event to the web page for processing.

13. The computer readable storage medium of claim 12, wherein a
sequence of the touch events is a touch start event, one or more touch move

events and a touch end or touch cancel event.

27
14. The computer readable storage medium of claim 12, wherein the web
page corresponds to a markup language document with attributes that define

event actions and that are associated with the gesture event.

15. The computer readable storage medium of claim 12, wherein the web
page corresponds to an HTML document with attributes in one or more
HTML tags that define event actions and that are associated with the gesture

event.

16. | А system comprising:
at least one processor (604);
a computer-readable medium according to any one of claims 12 to 15,

coupled to the at least one processor.

17. The system of claim 16, wherein the touch events are from a group of
touch events consisting of a touch start event, a touch move event, a touch

end event and a touch cancel event.

18. The system of claim 16, wherein two or more touch events are

determined to be a touch gesture.

19. The system of claim 16, wherein the touch events occur at substantially

the same time.
