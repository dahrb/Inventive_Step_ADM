I. The appeal is against the decision of the examining division to refuse the present European patent application on the grounds of lack of inventive step (Article 56 EPC) with respect to the claims of a main request and an auxiliary request, having regard to the disclosure of

D1: US-A-2005/0162402

combined with the skilled person's common general knowledge as exemplified by

D2: "Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Events Specification", Version 1.0, W3C Recommendation, pp. 1-47, 13 November 2000.

The following prior-art documents were also cited in the decision under appeal as evidence of the skilled person's common general knowledge:

D10: "Java Programming/Applets/Event Listeners", Internet document, 1 May 2007;

D11: M.H. Brown and M.A. Najork: "Distributed active objects", Computer Networks and ISDN Systems, Vol. 28, No. 11, pp. 1037-1052, May 1996.

Further prior-art documents quoted in the course of the examination proceedings included the following:

D3: EP-A-1 517 228;

D6: US-A-2006/0026521.

II. With the statement setting out the grounds of appeal, the appellant filed amended sets of claims as a main request and two auxiliary requests. It requested that the decision of the examining division be set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of one of the filed claim requests.

III. In an annex to the summons to oral proceedings pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA, the board gave its preliminary opinion on the appeal. In particular, it raised objections under Article 123(2) EPC with regard to the first auxiliary request and under Article 56 EPC with regard to the other claim requests on file, mainly having regard to D2 combined with the disclosure of

D12: S. Ramachandran and R. Kashi: "An Architecture for Ink Annotations on Web Documents", Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, pp. 256-260, August 2003.

Prior-art document D12 was introduced into the appeal proceedings by the board under Article 114(1) EPC due to its relevance for the assessment of novelty and inventive step of the underlying subject-matter.

IV. With a letter of reply, the appellant submitted amended claims according to four additional auxiliary requests as auxiliary requests A to D.

V. Oral proceedings were held as scheduled on 7 July 2015, during which the main request and the first auxiliary request ("auxiliary request A") were discussed. Following this discussion the appellant withdrew all other claim requests on file.

The appellant's final request was that the decision under appeal be set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of the claims of the main request or of auxiliary request A.

At the end of the oral proceedings, the decision of the board was announced.

VI. Claim 1 of the main request reads as follows:

"A method for processing touches comprising:

receiving (302) simultaneous touch input signals associated with two or more regions of a web page (100) displayed on a touch sensitive device (400), wherein each region is associated with a different respective node (152-160) in a document object model (150);

determining (304) two or more separate touch events associated with the two or more regions of the web page based on the touch input signals;

detecting a gesture event by combining the two or more separate touch events associated with the two or more regions of the web page; and

sending the gesture event to the web page for processing."

Claim 1 of auxiliary request A reads as follows:

"A method for processing touches comprising:

receiving (302) first and second touch input signals simultaneously, wherein the first and second touch input signals are associated with first and second regions, respectively, of a web page (100) displayed on a touch sensitive device (400), wherein each region is associated with a different respective node (152-160) in a document object model (150), the first touch input signal corresponds to a first touch input at a first location that corresponds to the first region of the web page, the second touch input signal corresponds to a second touch input at a second location that corresponds to the second region of the web page, and the second location is distinct from the first location;

determining (304) a first touch event associated with the first region of the web page based on the first touch input signal;

determining (304) a second touch event associated with the second region of the web page based on the second touch input signal;

detecting a gesture event by combining the at least the first and second touch events; and

sending the gesture event to the web page for processing."

The further independent claim 12 of both claim requests is directed to a corresponding computer program.
