TITLE: Adaptive HARQ for fixed TTI using soft acknowledgement

TYPE: Working Group Document

DOCUMENT:

We showed a physical layer structure and coding scheme that combines the advantages of the conventional fixed 
and variable TTI proposals by allowing to use two parallel data streams for each TTI. The main benefits are: 
• flexible mapping of required retransmission energy using MCS level and code rate adaptation, as 
well as bit mapping, 
• reduced interference, 
• allows soft-combining of retransmissions at different MCS levels,
• high frame fill efficiency, 
• increased throughput, 
• maintains simplicity of fixed TTI. 
The concepts presented in this paper are suitable for incremental redundancy, but can also be adapted to Chase 
combining.
