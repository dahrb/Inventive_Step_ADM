I. This appeal ("second appeal") is against the decision of the examining division ("second decision"), posted on 30 November 2010, to refuse European patent application No. 02028629.0 on the grounds that the prior art was not properly acknowledged (Rule 27(1)(b) EPC 1973), that the two-part form was not properly provided (Rule 29(1)(a)(b) EPC 1973), and that the subject-matter of the application lacked an inventive step (Article 56 EPC) with respect to a main request, a first auxiliary request, and a second auxiliary request, having regard to the disclosure of

A previous appeal ("first appeal") against the former decision of the examining division ("first decision"), posted on 16 February 2009, to refuse the present patent application on the grounds that the prior art was not properly acknowledged (Rule 42(1)(b) EPC), that the two-part form was not properly provided (Rule 43(1) EPC), and that the claims lacked clarity (Article 84 EPC) with respect to a sole request was settled by a decision, taken by this board in an entirely different composition ("the former board"), ordering that the first decision be set aside, that the case be remitted to the examining division for further prosecution, and that the appeal fee be reimbursed following a substantial procedural violation committed by the examining division (cf. T 1123/09). As to the reasoning of that decision, the former board held inter alia that the appellant had the right to amend the description to acknowledge the respective prior-art documents following the objection raised by the examining division under Rule 27(1)(b) EPC 1973 (cf. point 3), that the formulation of the pending independent claims in the two-part form had to be postponed (cf. point 4), that the objected claims were clear (cf. point 6), and that the examining division had committed a substantial procedural violation in using new and unsupported principles with regard to the application of

Rule 27(1)(b) EPC 1973 (Rule 42(1)(b) EPC) in that case (cf. point 8).

II. Notice of appeal was received on 10 February 2011. The appeal fee was paid on the same day. With the statement setting out the grounds of appeal, received on 8 April 2011, the appellant filed new claims according to a main request, a first auxiliary request, and a second auxiliary request. It requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of the main request or any of the auxiliary requests. In addition, oral proceedings were requested as an auxiliary measure.

III. A summons to oral proceedings scheduled for 1 October 2013 was issued on 11 July 2013. In an annex to this summons, the board expressed its preliminary opinion on the appeal pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA. In particular, objections were raised by the board under Articles 123(2) and 56 EPC, in view of D2 and D7.

IV. With a letter of reply dated 30 August 2013, the appellant filed amended claims according to a main request and an auxiliary request. It also submitted arguments as to why D7 did not disclose the established distinguishing features and advised that a "more detailed explanation" would be provided during the oral proceedings.

V. Oral proceedings were held as scheduled on 1 October 2013, during which the former main and auxiliary requests were replaced by a new main request (claims 1 to 8) as a sole request in response to objections raised by the board under Articles 123(2) and 56 EPC. The main request was admitted into the appeal proceedings and its patentability was discussed.

The appellant's final request was that the decision under appeal be set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of the main request as filed during the oral proceedings before the board. At the end of the oral proceedings, the board announced its decision.

VI. Claim 1 of the main request reads as follows:

"An apparatus for data transmission in a communication system, comprising:

a turbo encoder (220) for turbo coding data bits to generate systematic bits and parity bits;

a rate matcher (230) for rate matching the systematic bits and parity bits;

a first and second interleaver (250, 260) for separately writing the rate-matched systematic bits and the rate-matched parity bits; and

a modulator (280) for alternately mapping bits collected from the first interleaver and the second interleaver onto one modulation symbol according to a modulation scheme,

characterized in that

the first interleaver is arranged for writing the rate-matched systematic bits row by row from a first row to a last row, and the second interleaver is arranged for writing the rate-matched parity bits row by row from a first row to a last row, wherein the first and second interleavers are arranged for then separately interleaving the systematic bits and the parity bits by performing inter-column permutation, respectively, according to a determined rule,

wherein the modulator is arranged for alternately collecting the permutated bits column by column in the first interleaver and the second interleaver, and

wherein in case that a number of the rate-matched systematic bits is too large for them to be written into the first interleaver, the excessive number of rate-matched systematic bits is written in the second interleaver."

The further independent claim 4 of the main request is directed to a corresponding method, while independent claims 7 and 8 are directed to a complementary apparatus and method, respectively.
