I. The appeal is against the decision of the examining division, posted on 11 February 2011, to refuse European patent application No. 09159981.1 on the ground of lack of inventive step (Article 56 EPC) with respect to the independent claims of a main request and an auxiliary request, having regard to the disclosure of

D1: Y.C. Lai et al.: "Design and implementation of

a wireless internet remote access platform",

Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,

Vol. 6, pp. 413-429, 9 January 2006.

II. Notice of appeal was received on 7 April 2011. The appeal fee was paid on the same day. With the statement setting out the grounds of appeal, received on 11 May 2011, the appellant re-filed the claims of the main and the auxiliary requests underlying the appealed decision. It requested that the decision of the examining division be set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of the main request or the auxiliary request.

III. A summons to oral proceedings scheduled for 7 August 2014 was issued on 12 May 2014. In an annex to this summons, the board gave its preliminary opinion on the appeal pursuant to Article 15(1) RPBA. In particular, objections were raised under Article 56 EPC in view of D1 and the skilled person's common general knowledge.

IV. With a letter of reply dated 7 July 2014, the appellant submitted amended claims according to a new main request and a first auxiliary request. It also re-filed the claims of the previous auxiliary request as a second auxiliary request and provided counter-arguments with regard to the objections raised in the board's communication under Article 15(1) RPBA.

V. Following a request of the appellant, a telephone conversation was held between the appellant's representative and the rapporteur of this case during which the representative was informed that, according to the preliminary opinion of the board, the objections under Article 56 EPC were maintained.

VI. By letter of reply dated 5 August 2014, the appellant informed the board that it would not be attending the scheduled oral proceedings and requested that the appeal be allowed based on the pending requests filed on 7 July 2014. It also submitted that the claims of those requests had been "further distinguished over D1 to provide an inventive step" and had "placed the application in a condition ready for grant".

VII. Oral proceedings were held as scheduled on 7 August 2014 in the absence of the appellant. The board established from the file that the appellant's final request was that the decision under appeal be set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of one of the main request, the first auxiliary request and the second auxiliary request, all requests as filed with letter dated 7 July 2014.

After due deliberation on the basis of the pending requests and the written submissions, the board announced its decision at the end of the oral proceedings.

VIII. Claim 1 of the main request reads as follows:

"A method in a wireless hand-held device of composing an e-mail message that will include a remote file attachment, comprising:

receiving a user instruction to attach a file (410) to an e-mail message for at least one recipient;

in response to receiving the user instruction, requesting a file browsing service on a file delivery server via a network to obtain a list of files in a directory;

if file access credentials (418) are required to access the directory:

prompting for file access credentials (418)

needed to access the directory;

furnishing the file access credentials (428) to the file browsing service;

presenting the list of files using a user interface of the wireless hand-held device (422,424);

receiving another user instruction to send the e-mail message (428), along with a file from the list of files to attach to the e-mail message (426); and

sending, to a mail agent, a portion of the

e-mail message and an attachment instruction identifying the file and the file access credentials (430), wherein the attachment instruction causes the mail agent to assemble a complete e-mail message comprising at least the portion of the e-mail message and the file identified in the attachment instruction retrieved using the file access credentials (430) and the file delivery server (436)."

Claim 1 of the first auxiliary request comprises all the features of claim 1 of the main request with the only difference that the phrase "in response to receiving the user instruction" has been replaced by the clause "subsequent to receiving the user instruction" (cf. line 7 of claim 1).

Claim 1 of the second auxiliary request comprises all the features of claim 1 of the main request, except that the phrase "in response to receiving the user instruction" is no longer recited.
