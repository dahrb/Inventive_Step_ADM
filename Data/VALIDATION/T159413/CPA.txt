Grafton DBM Orthoblend Two distinct formulations combining 
(Osteotech) demineralized fibers with crushed or
uncrushed cancellous chips. Used in 
bony defects, total joint revisions and 
spinal fusions.

(Osteotech) tissue made from bone fibers, it is the most
versatile Grafton DBM form.
Grafton DBM Crunch A blend of demineralized fibers and cortical
(Osteotech) bone cubes that can be used in some spinal 
fusions, trauma defects, bone cysts and 
tumors, joint revisions and tibial plateaus.

graft site.
Grafton DBM Plus Offers good handling and osteoinductivity for
(Osteotech) trauma, total joint revisions and anterior and 
posterior spine procedures. Ideal for 
procedures requiring extensive irrigation.
