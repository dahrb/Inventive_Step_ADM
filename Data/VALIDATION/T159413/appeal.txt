I. The appeal lies from the decision of the Examining Division refusing European patent application No. 08 873 572.5.

II. Inter alia the following documents were cited in the examination proceedings:

(2) EP-A-82621,

(7) US-A-2004/220615,

(17) WO 2008/013763 and

(19) http://www.orthosupersite.com/images/content/OT/200505/DBM.pdf (pdf dated May 2005).

III. In the decision under appeal, the Examining Division found that that the subject-matter of the then pending main request did not fulfil the requirements of Articles 123(2) and 56 EPC. More particularly, it found that claim 1 of said request found a basis in the application as filed, but not the late-filed drawings. With regard to inventive step, a demineralised bone matrix (DBM) of document (19) represented the closest prior art, the subject-matter of said claim not being inventive thereover in the light of documents (2), (7) and/or (17), which taught porous mesh coverings for bone implants.

IV. With letter dated 23 January 2017, the Appellant (Applicant) submitted a main request and auxiliary requests 1 to 3 and 4a to 4d and withdrew the request made before the Examining Division to insert figures 13a to 13g into the specification. During oral proceedings before the Board, held on 23 February 2017, it filed a new main request, replacing the previous main request.

V. The Appellant submitted that the subject-matter of all requests complied with the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC. By withdrawing the request to insert figures 13a to 13g into the specification, the objections in point 12 of the contested decision under Article 123(2) EPC were overcome. With regard to inventive step, the product Grafton® DBM Crunch of document (19) represented the closest prior art. The declaration of Dr. D. Shimko filed with letter dated 23 January 2017 containing further experimental data comparing a delivery system according to the invention, namely Magnifuse® DBM, with said product, showed a performance improvement for Magnifuse® DBM over Grafton® DBM Crunch. Said improvement was unexpected, since at the date of filing of the present application it would have been counter-intuitive and gone against accepted teachings in this field for the skilled person seeking to promote bone fusion at a grafting site, to provide the bone products with a mesh covering which would act as a barrier between the bone products and the bone, inter alia document (23) being cited in this respect:

(23) D. G. Marchesi: "Spinal fusions: bone and bone substitutes", Eur. Spine J., 2000, 9, pages 372 to 378.

The skilled person would not have turned to the teachings of documents (2), (7) and/or (17) when seeking to develop an improved bone void filler product to maximise bone tissue regeneration. The claimed subject-matter was thus inventive.

VI. The Appellant requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of the main request as filed during oral proceedings before the Board, or, subsidiarily, on the basis of any of the auxiliary requests 1 to 3 and 4a to 4d as filed with letter dated 23 January 2017.

VII. At the end of the oral proceedings, the decision of the Board was announced.
