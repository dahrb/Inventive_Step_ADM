I. The applicant (appellant) filed an appeal against the decision of the Examining Division posted on 8 August 2008 refusing European patent application No. 03076109.2.

II. The decision made reference to the following documents:

D1: Wongvasu N. et al.: "Representing the relationship between items in logical bill-of-material to support customers' requests for quotation for make-to-order products", Proceedings of SPIE, Vol. 4192, p. 74-85 (2000); and

D3: Gu P. et al.: "Product modelling using STEP", Computer-Aided Design, Vol. 27, No. 3, p. 163-179, (March 1995).

The Examining Division decided that the main request contravened Article 123(2) EPC, that claim 1 of the first auxiliary request lacked an inventive step over a combination of documents D1 and D3, but also without reference to a document, and that the second auxiliary request again contravened Article 123(2) EPC.

III. With the statement of grounds of appeal, the appellant filed a copy of the post-published document

D4: Callahan S.: "Extended Generic Product Structure: An Information Model for Representing Product Families", Journal of Computing and Information Science in Engineering, Vol. 6, p. 263-275 (September 2006).

The appellant further indicated that a declaration by an expert in the field was expected to be filed soon. No such declaration has been submitted.

The appellant requested that the decision be set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of a main request or, in the alternative, on the basis of a first or a second auxiliary request. According to the statement of grounds of appeal, the main request corresponded to the first auxiliary request as filed in the first-instance proceedings and the first auxiliary request corresponded to the second auxiliary request as filed in the first-instance proceedings.

IV. The claims of the main request, the first auxiliary request ("auxiliary request I") and the second auxiliary request ("auxiliary request II") were filed on 22 December 2008 together with the "confirmation copy" of the statement of grounds of appeal, i.e. after expiry of the time limit for the statement of grounds of appeal. The claims of the main request corresponded to those of the first auxiliary request before the department of first instance. Claim 1 of auxiliary request I corresponded to claim 1 of the second auxiliary request before the department of first instance. The dependent claims of auxiliary request I differed from those of the second auxiliary request before the department of first instance.

V. The Board appointed oral proceedings. In a communication accompanying the summons to oral proceedings, the Board provisionally expressed a negative opinion on all requests. Among other objections, claim 1 of both the main request and auxiliary request I appeared to lack an inventive step. Questions were raised regarding the admissibility of auxiliary request II.

VI. With a letter dated 11 February 2014, the appellant informed the Board that it would not appear at the oral proceedings. The letter did not address any of the issues raised in the communication accompanying the summons.

VII. The oral proceedings were held on 10 March 2014 in the absence of the appellant. At the end of the oral proceedings the chairman announced the decision of the Board.

VIII. Claim 1 of the main request reads as follows:

"A method of designing products using CAD and of manufacturing products using CAM, wherein a product data-model is stored in a memory associated with a computer, said product data-model representing product information about at least one component that is a constituent of at least one parent assembly, comprising:

a parent assembly and two or more children, each comprising at least one component, said parent assembly holding information for associating the two children with the parent assembly;

a plurality of component-usages for holding information relating to usages of the component, said component-usages being operatively connected to a component of the parent assembly;

a plurality of logical component-usages for holding information relating to logical usages of the component, said logical component-usages being operatively connected to said component-usages; and

said parent assembly, said component-usages and said logical component-usages being hierarchically interconnected."

IX. Claim 1 of auxiliary request I reads as follows:

"A method of designing products using CAD and of manufacturing products using CAM, wherein a product data-model is stored in a memory associated with a computer, said product data-model representing product information about at least one component that is a constituent of at least one parent assembly, said data model comprising a parent assembly and two or more children, said parent assembly holding information for associating the two children with the parent assembly, said method comprising:

selecting one component-usage to be included in a product configuration from a plurality of component-usages in said data model and for holding information relating to usages of the component;

selecting one from the component-usages connected to it from a plurality of logical component-usages of said data model and for holding information relating to logical usages of the component, said logical component-usages being operatively connected to said component-usages; wherein said logical component-usages are used to identify the existence of a role for said component-usages in an assembly configuration represented by a general motional [sic] mechanism for expressing to which particular configuration each logical component-usage and component-usage is applicable, the logical component usages are labeled with applicability attributes (O1, O2) that determine whether they apply to a given product configuration, including option attributes (O1, O2) of which the options are mutually exclusive."

X. Claim 1 of auxiliary request II reads as follows:

"A method for representing assembly configurations using a generalized occurrence structure stored in a memory, comprising:

(a) constructing a plurality of occurrence nodes corresponding to paths in a representation of a product data-model comprising hierarchically interconnected parent assembly, a plurality of component-usages, and a plurality of logical component-usages;

(b) constructing a plurality of logical occurrence nodes associated with a plurality of said occurrence nodes;

(c) storing product data in said occurrence nodes;

(d) associating a plurality of part-interfaces with said occurrence nodes;

(e) associating a plurality of part usages with a plurality of logical occurrence nodes depending upon logical relationships between said part-usages; and

(f) forming a mapping of a plurality of computer-aided designs of said parts with said product data-model

wherein said step (a) further comprises

forming a mapping of at least one manufacturing assembly sequence to at least one computer-aided-design that is stored in said product data model, said manufacturing assembly sequence comprising a plurality of manufacturing assemblies which include a plurality of components and a plurality of assemblies, wherein it is ensured by an effectivity or applicability scheme that for any one valid assembly configuration of the parent assembly 12 using the logical component usage node 18, there is only one component usage node 14, the logical component usage node 18 determining which one of the multiple (if any) component usage nodes 14 associated with it becomes part of a given valid assembly configuration of the parent assembly 12."

XI. In support of inventive step, the appellant essentially argued as follows:

The data models described in the claims were used in the technical field of computer-aided design systems and computer-aided manufacturing environments. In this technical field virtual product modelling could expedite a design process for a family of products sharing an overall product architecture. The designer could customise the product selected from a product family that included many product variants.

Before the present invention, a designer reconstructed relationships between product design domains, either mentally or with some minimal computer support. Manual tracking of such relationships incurred high costs and was prone to errors. Reduced use of effectivity, viz. defining which part went into each end product configuration, meant diminishing knowledge of what was common among different product designs.

The invention avoided the undesirable situation where there were many copies of engineering bill-of-material assembly definitions that were similar but had unique copies of product structure definitions. In addition, multiple and independent drawings, CAD data and product structures for variance were eliminated.

The "logical component usage" concept was used to check the consistency of the selection of component usages and was a mechanism to help designers understand which component usages were alternative to each other, versus which component usages fulfilled different purposes in the design.

The present invention introduced logical component usage as an abstraction of component usage. In the prior art a component usage was considered to be a relationship object. It was counter-intuitive to consider abstracting a relationship.

The invention introduced the idea of considering a component usage as a lightweight copy of a component instead of as a relationship. This allowed component usage to be abstracted, since it had become a virtual thing instead of a relationship. This concept of a lightweight copy was further introduced in document D4.
