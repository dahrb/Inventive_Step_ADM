TITLE: Representing the relationship between items in logical
bill-of-material to support customers’ request for quotation for
make-to-order products

TYPE: Academic Paper

ABSTRACT: 

For make-to-order products in which the specification of some component-product variants are to be defined by
customers, it is almost impossible to develop a bill-of-material system that support customers’ requests for quotation
(RFQ) response activities usingthe existingbill-of-material concepts. To deal with this problem, a new technique
for representingthe relationship between parent-product variants and component-product variants in the generic
bill-of-material (GBOM) structure is developed. The new technique is based on an assumption that the relationship
between any two components in a product structure has pairwise independent property. The technique represents the
relationship with compatibility constraints in the form of matrices and rules. The new representation provides users
with a means to describingvariants of make-to-order products as well as supportingthe customers’ RFQ response
activities with only a limited amount of data which is comprehensive, easy to maintain, and easy to understand.
