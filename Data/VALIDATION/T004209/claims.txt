1. A method of designing products using CAD and of
manufacturing products using CAM, wherein a product data-model is stored in a memory associated with a computer, said
product data-model representing product information about at
least one component that is a constituent of at least one
parent assembly, comprising: a parent assembly and two or more children, each comprising at least one component, said parent assembly
holding information for associating the two children with
the parent assembly; a plurality of component-usages for holding information
relating to usages of the component, said component-usages being operatively connected to a component of the parent
assembly; a plurality of logical component-usages for holding
information relating to logical usages of the component,
said logical component-usages being operatively connected to said component-usages; and said parent assembly, said component-usages and said logical component-usages being hierarchically
interconnected.

2. The method of claim 1, wherein said
logical component-usage is utilized for selecting one from

the component-usages connected to it.

3. The method of claim 1, whereinsaid logical component-usages are used to identify the
existence of a role for said component-usages in an assemblyconfiguration.

4. The method of claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein said
component-usages are utilized for selecting one component

usage to be included in a product configuration.

5. The method of any of claims 1-4, wherein said
component-usages represent usages of a plurality of items
and logical component-usages represent logical usages of

said items.

6. The method of any of claims 1-5 comprising:

(a) constructing a plurality of occurrence nodes
corresponding to paths in a representation of the product
data-model comprising a hierarchically interconnected parent
assembly, a plurality of component-usages, and a plurality
of logical component-usages;

(b) constructing a plurality of logical occurrence
nodes associated with a plurality of said occurrences nodes;
and

(с) storing product data in said occurrence nodes.

7. The method of claim 6, step (a) further comprising:

associating a plurality of part-interfaces with said
occurrence nodes;

associating a plurality of part usages with a plurality
of logical occurrence nodes depending upon logical
relationships between said part-usages; and

forming a mapping of a plurality of computer-aided-

designs of said parts with said product data-model.

8. The method of claim 6 or 7, wherein said step (a)
further comprises:

forming a mapping of at least one manufacturing
assembly sequence to at least one computer-aided-design that
is stored in said product data model, said manufacturing
assembly sequence comprising a plurality of manufacturing
assemblies which include a plurality of components and a

plurality of assemblies.

9. The method of claim 6, 7 or 8, wherein said step (a)
further comprises:

forming a mapping from of a subset of the product data
model, for any design domain of a given product family, to a
subset of any other design domain representing another

design aspect of the same product family.

10. The method of any of claims 6-9, wherein said step
(a) further comprises:

forming a mapping from a whole of the product data
model, for any design domain of a given product family, and
part or all of any other design domain representing another

aspect of the design of the same product family.
