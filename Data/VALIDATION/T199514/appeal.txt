I. The applicant appealed against the decision of the Examining Division, dispatched on 13 May 2014, to refuse the European patent application No. 04769910.3. The statement setting out the grounds of appeal was received on 16 September 2014.

II. The Examining Division refused the second and third auxiliary requests which were remitted to it following a decision by the present Board of Appeal in a different composition in case T 1983/09.

III. In case T 1983/09 the Board considered that the amendments made at the appeal stage had substantially changed the factual framework of the contested decision, and that an additional search could have been required to determine the relevant prior art (see penultimate paragraph of item 5.1 of that decision).

IV. In the decision under appeal in the present case the Examining Division held that the application did not meet the requirements of Article 56 EPC, having regard to document US 6 400 101 B1 (D5) in combination with the common general knowledge of a skilled person.

V. The appellant requested in writing that the decision under appeal be set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of a set of claims filed with the statement of grounds of appeal and corresponding to the claims of the former second auxiliary request.

VI. Claim 1 according to the appellant's sole request reads as follows.

"A system (20) for supplying power to an LED load (10), the system (20) comprising:

a LED driver module (30) operable to regulate a flow of a LED current (ILED) through the LED load (10) as a function of a temperature-dependent feedback signal (TDFS); and

a current controller module (60) in electric communication with said LED driver module (30) to communicate the temperature-dependent feedback signal (TDFS) to said LED driver module (10),

wherein said current controller module (60) is operable to generate the temperature-dependent feedback signal (TDFB) as a function of an operating temperature of the LED load (10) and the flow of the LED current (ILED) through the LED load (10), and

wherein said current controller module (600) includes:

means for generating a temperature feedback signal (VTF) as a function of a sensed operating temperature of the LED load (10);

wherein the temperature feedback signal is a temperature feedback voltage (VTF) and said current controller module (600) includes: a first operational amplifier (U1) operable to generate the temperature feedback voltage (VTF) as a function of the operating temperature of the LED load (10);

means for generating a current feedback signal (VCF) as a function of a sensed flow of the LED current (ILED) through the LED load (10);

wherein the current feedback signal is a current feedback voltage (VCF) and said current controller module (60) includes: a second operational amplifier (U2) operable to generate the current feedback voltage (VCF) as a function of the flow of the LED current (ILED) through the LED load (10); and

means for mixing the temperature feedback signal (VTF) and the current feedback signal (VCF) to yield the temperature and current-dependent feedback signal (TDFB),

wherein the temperature and current-dependent feedback signal (TDFB) is a feedback voltage generated as a mixture of the temperature feedback voltage (VTF) and the current feedback voltage (VCF)."

Claims 2 to 14 are dependent on claim 1.

VII. The appellant's arguments as far as they are relevant for the present decision can be summarised as follows:

The request in this appeal corresponded to the second auxiliary request addressed in the decision under appeal.

Claim 1 involved an inventive step over the disclosure of D5, D6 (US2002/130786 A1) and the alleged, but unproven "knowledge of the skilled person".

In D5, there was no disclosure of the following features which were required by claim 1 :

(i) a means for generating a temperature feedback signal which is a temperature feedback voltage (VTF) generated by a first operational amplifier (U1),

(ii) a means for generating a current feedback signal which is a current feedback voltage (VCF) generated by a second operational amplifier (U2), and

(iii) a means for mixing those signals to yield a temperature and current-dependent feedback signal (TDFB) which is a feedback voltage generated as a mixture of the temperature feedback voltage (VTF) and the current feedback voltage (VCF).

In the decision in case T 1983/09 the Board of Appeal held that D5 did not objectively disclose features (i) and (ii) identified above. The Board also stated that "D5 is indeed silent about the type of signal generated by the temperature regulation means and about the adder connected to the inverting input of the regulation means". Thus, according to the Board, D5 did not objectively disclose a temperature feedback voltage, so that feature (iii), which mentioned such a "temperature feedback voltage", was not disclosed either.

In paragraph 3.1.2 of the contested decision the Examining Division agreed that features (i) and (ii) were not disclosed in D5, but concluded, as stated in paragraph 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 of the decision that feature (iii) was disclosed in D5. This conclusion was not correct and contrary to the findings of fact stated by the Board of Appeal in the Reasons for the Decision in the case T 1983/09.

By providing these features in combination with the remaining features recited in claim 1, the claimed system provided a simple current controller module which provided a continuous feedback control of the LED as a function of both the sensed operating temperature of the LED load and the LED current through the LED load. In particular, it provided continuous control (page 11 , line 31 to page 12, line 6 of the original specification) over a wide temperature range. The two operational amplifiers operated independently to generate the respective voltage signals, which were then mixed. The use of the two operational amplifiers provided substantially aligned current and temperature control, and enabled the system to respond rapidly to current and temperature fluctuations.

As shown in Figure 3 of the present specification, the LED load was continuously controlled over a wide temperature range, based on the selection of a respective operational relationship between the resistive value of the LED load operating temperature sensor and the current through the LED load.

This technical effect of continuous control of current supplied to a LED driver with respect to temperature over an operating temperature range, in particular over a wide temperature range, had application, for example, in LED luminaires providing high quality light of a desired tuned colour temperature.

The objective technical problem starting from D5 was to provide a more simplified responsive feedback control of the power supply to the LED load so as to provide a temperature dependent control of the current supplied to the LED which could be continuous control of current supplied dependent on temperature over the operating temperature range.

The purpose of the circuitry of D5 on the other hand was primarily to prevent the LED from destruction resulting from an increased ambient temperature. Figure 3 of D5 showed the relationship between the forward current of the LED and ambient temperature. The current was constant up to an ambient temperature of 70°C and then was linearly reduced up to a maximum ambient temperature of 100°C, at which temperature the forward current of the LED was switched off. There was no disclosure or hint in D5 to solve the problem of providing a temperature dependent control of the current supplied to the LED as a continuous control of current supplied dependent on temperature over the operating temperature range.

Referring to paragraph 3.1.4 of the contested decision, even though operational amplifiers might have been known generally, there was no hint to the skilled person in D5 or D6, or in the common general knowledge, to somehow introduce two respective operational amplifiers into the circuit of Figure 8 of D5 in the specific manner recited in claim 1 and to process the specific respective signals recited in claim 1 in order to solve the correctly formulated objective technical problem. Moreover, no evidence of the common general knowledge had been provided.

The examining division relied upon D6 to assert that the skilled person, starting from D5, would "always consider the use of operational amplifiers for processing the measured signals". This unsubstantiated assertion indicated that the Examining Division had wrongly used hindsight in their analysis of inventive step.
