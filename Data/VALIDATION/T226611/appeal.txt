I. European patent application No. 05 766 869.1 relates to a crystalline (3R)-l-(2-methylalanyl-D-tryptophyl)-3-(phenylmethyl)-3- piperidinecarboxylic acid 1,2,2-trimethylhydrazide, i.e. a crystalline form of the compound known by the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) anamorelin.

II. During the oral proceedings of 16 December 2010, the examining division decided that the subject-matter of the claims of the main request then on file was not inventive, whereas the claims of the auxiliary request submitted during said oral proceedings met the requirements of the EPC. The applicant was given a period of two months to file a description adapted to the claims of the auxiliary request.

In the communication dated 18 March 2011, the examining division granted an extension of this period to a total of four months.

In its reply dated 21 April 2011, the applicant indicated that it disagreed with the decision concerning the main request and that it would not limit the application according to the auxiliary request.

III. With its decision posted on 16 May 2011, the examining division refused the application.

In particular, the examining division decided that the subject-matter of the claims of the only request then on file was not inventive in view of document (D1), especially in view of step j of its example 1. It was obvious to recrystallise the amorphous form obtained in that step.

IV. The following documents were cited during examination and appeal proceedings:

(D1) US-B-6 576 648

(D2) Lab journal, project no. B-3289/3290,

book no. BOP-T, 12 to 16 January 2006,

pages 100-103

(D3) Declaration of Mr. Neal G. Anderson dated

21 September 2011, filed under cover of a letter

dated 22 September 2011, eleven pages including

Annexes 1 and 2 and the CV of Mr Anderson.

V. The applicant appealed this decision.

VI. In its communications dated 5 June 2014 and 10 April 2015, the board informed the appellant of deficiencies in the claims of the main request and in the description. Once these were overcome, the main request was likely to be considered allowable.

VII. With the replies dated 12 February and 21 May 2015, the appellant submitted amended claims of the main request and amended pages 1, 7, 23, 35, 35a and 35b of the description. In its letter dated 28 May 2015, the appellant requested the deletion of page 35b.

VIII. The present claims are

- claims 1 to 15 of the main request, filed with the letter dated 21 May 2015; and

- claims 1 to 6 of the auxiliary request, submitted during the oral proceedings of 16 December 2010.

The independent claims 1, 6, 14 and 15 and dependent claim 4 of the main request read as follows:

"1. A crystalline (3R)-l-(2-methylalanyl-D-tryptophyl)-3-(phenylmethyl)-3-piperidinecarboxylic acid 1,2,2-trimethylhydrazide."

"4. The crystalline composition of Claim 3, wherein the hydrate is a dihydrate."

"6. A process for preparing crystalline (3R)-1-(2-

methylalanyl-D-tryptophyl)-3- (phenylmethyl)-3-

piperidinecarboxylic acid 1,2,2-trimethylhydrazide as set forth in claim 4, comprising the steps of:

a) combining (3R)-1-(2-methylalanyl-D-tryptophyl)-3-

(phenylmethyl)-3-piperidinecarboxylic acid 1,2,2-

trimethylhydrazide with a solvent; wherein the

solvent is selected from the group consisting of

methanol and mixtures thereof with water;

b) precipitating the crystals from the solvent; and

c) isolating the crystals."

"14. A pharmaceutical composition comprising

the crystalline (3R)-1-(2-methylalanyl-D-

tryptophyl)-3-(phenylmethyl)-3-

piperidinecarboxylic acid 1,2,2-trimethylhydrazide

of claim 4 and at least one pharmaceutically

acceptable carrier or diluent."

"15. Use of a therapeutically effective amount of the crystalline (3R)-1-(2-methylalanyl-D-tryptophyl)-3-(phenylmethyl)-3-piperidinecarboxylic acid 1,2,2-trimethylhydrazide of claim 4 in the manufacture of a medicament for stimulating the release of growth hormone from the pituitary of a mammal."

The main request comprises the following amended pages of the description:

- pages 1, 35 and 35a, enclosed with the letter dated 21 May 2015 and

- pages 7 and 23, enclosed with the letter dated 12 February 2015.

IX. The appellant requested that the decision under appeal be set aside and that a patent be granted on the basis of the main request or, as a subsidiary measure, on the basis of the claims of the auxiliary request. Oral proceedings were requested in case the main request was not allowed,.

X. As the appellant's main request is granted, there was no need to hold oral proceedings.
