Title: METHOD FOR STORING AND MANAGING

Abstract: 
A method for Storing and managing data on a Storage 
medium connected to a computer System, wherein the data 
consists of a plurality of data elements and a plurality of 
tags, wherein each of the data elements is assigned one of the 
tags to form a plurality of pairs each consisting of at least 
one of the data elements and one of the tags, wherein each 
of the pairs is assigned a position in a hierarchical Structure, 
wherein each of the pairs is Stored and managed on the 
Storage medium together with a pair-individual hierarchy 
indicator indicating the position of the pair in the hierarchi 
cal Structure. Furthermore, a computer program for carrying 
out this metod and a data carrier storing such a program are provided.

lowing Searching Schemas: performing a Search in Said data 
elements, performing a Search in Said tags, performing an 
interconnected Search in Said data elements and in Said tags. 4. A method according to claim 3, wherein, if Said data 
elements comprise text portions, Said Search in Said data 
elements is performed by Searching Said text portions fully. 
5. A method according to claim 1, wherein said managing of Said pairs comprises automatically initializing a routine 
when a predefined event occurs. 
6. A method according to claim 5, wherein Said predefined 
event is a result obtained by means of a Searching function 
or a storing function. 
7. A method according to claim 1, wherein Said managing 
of Said pairs comprises displaying Said hierarchical Structure 
of Said pairs on an output device. 
8. A method according to claim 1, wherein each of Said 
data elements is operable to be positioned at any place in 
Said hierarchical Structure in response to user input. 9. A method according to claim 1, wherein Said managing of Said pairs comprises performing an undo function for 
undoing Storing and managing actions. 
10. A method according to claim 1, wherein Said pairs are 
formatted in the XML format. 
11. A method according to claim 1, wherein Said computer 
System is connected to various Storage mediums via a data 
connection. 
12. A computer-readable carrier medium comprising pro 
gram instructions, wherein the program instructions are 
executable to implement: 
assigning a tag of a plurality of tags to each of a plurality 
of data elements to form a plurality of pairs, each of 
Said pairs comprising at least one of Said data elements 
and one of Said tags, wherein each of Said pairs is 
assigned a position in a hierarchical Structure; and 
Storing and managing the pairs on a computer readable 
medium connected to a computer System, wherein each 
of Said pairs is Stored and managed on Said computer 
readable medium together with a pair-individual hier 
archy indicator indicating Said position of Said pair in 
Said hierarchical Structure, 
wherein Said Storing and managing further comprises 
listing each of Said pairs in an index, wherein Said index 
contains hierarchy information about Said position of 
each of Said pairs in Said hierarchical Structure. 
13. The computer-readable carrier medium of claim 12, wherein Said hierarchy information includes said pair individual hierarchy indicator for each of Said pairs. 14. The computer-readable carrier medium of claim 12, wherein Said managing the pairs comprises Searching through said pairs in response to user input using a Searching function allowing the following Searching Schemas: per forming a Search in Said data elements, performing a Search 
in Said tags, performing an interconnected Search in Said data 
elements and in Said tags. 15. The computer-readable carrier medium of claim 14, wherein, if Said data elements comprise text portions, Said 
Search in Said data elements is performed by Searching Said 
text portions fully. 
16. The computer-readable carrier medium of claim 12, wherein Said managing of Said pairs comprises automati 
cally initializing a routine when a predefined event occurs. 
17. The computer-readable carrier medium of claim 12, 
wherein Said predefined event is a result obtained by means 
of a Searching function or a Storing function. 
18. The computer-readable carrier medium of claim 12, wherein Said managing of Said pairs comprises displaying 
Said hierarchical Structure of Said pairs on an output device. 
19. The computer-readable carrier medium of claim 12,
