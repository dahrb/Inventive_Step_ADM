I. The appeal is against the decision of the examining division to refuse the patent application in suit.

II. The examining division decided, inter alia, that the main request lacked clarity (Article 84 EPC) and an inventive step (Article 56 EPC) with regard to the following document:

D1: US 5 778 418.

III. With its statement setting out the grounds of appeal, the appellant filed claims 1 to 13 of an amended main request. The appellant requested that the decision be set aside and a patent be granted based on its amended main request. It requested oral proceedings as an auxiliary measure.

IV. In its preliminary opinion annexed to the summons to oral proceedings, the board raised objections under Article 84 EPC and Article 56 EPC with regard to D1 or, alternatively, the following document, cited in the search report:

D3: US 2005/172074

V. In its reply, the appellant re-filed its last main request and filed claims 1 to 3 of two auxiliary requests. At the oral proceedings held before the board, the appellant replaced these auxiliary requests with claim 1 of a new first auxiliary request.

VI. Claim 1 of the main request reads as follows:

" A storage system comprising:

a plurality of storage media (140, 150) organized as hybrid storage media that cooperate to provide a total storage space of the storage system (120), the hybrid storage media including solid-state devices (SSDs) and hard disk drives (HDDs);

characterized in that:

the system comprises a log-structured file system (240) that implements a first data layout format for the SSDs (330) and a second data layout format for the HDDs (360), said system configured to control the hybrid storage media by performing the initial placement of data among storage space locations of the hybrid storage media, migration of selected data from the SSDs to the HDDs, and write allocation of available storage space locations of the hybrid storage media,wherein the migration of the selected data from the SSDs (330) to the HDDs (360) includes:

identifying related file data stored according to said first data layout format at the SSDs (330),

copying the related file data into a log (146) of the log-structured file system (240), and

storing the blocks of related file data at the HDDs (360) according to said second data layout format using regions of the HDDs (360), where each region contains a contiguous range of file block numbers;

and further wherein a write anywhere technique is implemented for the SSDs (330) in accordance with the first data layout format to enable placement of data anywhere in free, available space on the SSDs (330), and a sequential write technique is implemented for the HDDs (360) in accordance with the second data layout format by streaming data to the HDDs."

VII. Claim 1 of the first auxiliary request differs from claim 1 of the main request in that

- "a log-structured file system (240) that implements" is deleted, and

- the feature of "copying the related file data into a log (146) of the log-structured file system (240)" is replaced with "copying the related file data into a memory".
