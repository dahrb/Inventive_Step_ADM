CLAIMS

A method for implementing a second-chance game or an end of game
drawing for players of a lottery game, comprising the steps of:

providing tickets (110) for the lottery game, wherein the tickets
(110) are each assigned a unique validation code (112);

applying an algorithm to generate a unique, first encryption
code (120) for each ticket validation code (112);

storing the first encryption code (120) in a first record (130) ata
lottery provider;

distributing the tickets (110) for possession by players of the lot-
tery game;

conducting the lottery game;

allowing players to submit the unique validation codes (112) for
registration into a lottery provider's database;

on the part of the lottery provider, applying the algorithm to the
submitted validation codes (112) to create a second encryption code
(135) for each submitted validation code (112);

on the part of the lottery provider, comparing the second en-
cryption code (135) with the record (130) of first encryption codes
(120) to determine whether a match exists; and

on the part of the lottery provider, if a match exists, registering
the ticket (110) in a second record (155) by storing the second encryp-
tion code (135) for the ticket (110), wherein the second record (155)
comprises only those encryption codes (135) verified to be eligible for
the second-chance or end of game drawing; and

conducting the second-chance or end of game drawing with the
tickets (110), whose encryption codes (135) are stored in the second
record (155).

The method according to claim 1, wherein said registering step com-
prises recording identification information provided by the player, and
wherein winners in the second-chance or end of game drawing are no-
tified by the lottery provider based on the identification information so
that the winners need not retain the lottery ticket (110) after said regis-

tration step.

The method according to claim 1, further comprising the step of reject-
ing a Submitted validation code (112) where there is no match be-
tween the second encryption code (135) and the record (130) of first
encryption codes (120).

The method according to claim 1, wherein said step of allowing play-
ers to submit the unique validation code (112) comprises providing a
website accessible over the internet by which players may provide the

unique validation code (112) from the ticket (110).

The method according to claim 4, wherein the website locks out a
player who submits three validation codes (112) that do not result in a

match.

The method according to claim 4, wherein for a predetermined period
of time the website locks out a player who submits three validation

codes (112) that do not result in a match.

The method according to claim 1, wherein said comparing step further
comprises determining whether a validation code (112) that results in
a matching first and second encryption code (120, 135) has already

been submitted.

The method according to claim 1, wherein said providing step com-
prises providing the validation code (112) on the ticket (110) and un-

der a coating that is removable by a player.

The method according to claim 1, wherein the algorithm is the MD5

algorithm.

The method according to claim 1, wherein the algorithm provides the
same unique encryption code (120, 135) for each entry of a particular

validation code (112).

The method according to claim 1, where the validation code (112) is

an alphanumeric code.
