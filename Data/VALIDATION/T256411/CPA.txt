Claims:

What is claimed is:
1. A multi-layered collagen film for use in controlled release of an active ingredient, said film comprising one or two rate controlling layers and one or more drug reservoir layers, said layers comprising non-fibrillar collagen and contacting each other in a stacked conformation such that a rate controlling layer is situated at one or both ends of the stack and contacts only one other layer, said other layer being a drug reservoir layer.
2. A collagen film according to claim 1 wherein one or both rate controlling layers further comprise an active ingredient.
3. A collagen film according to claim 1 wherein said rate controlling layers are devoid of any active ingredient.
4. A collagen film according to claim 3 wherein each of said drug reservoir layers further comprises an active ingredient.
5. A collagen film according to claim 4 wherein the number of said drug reservoir layers is from one to five.
6. A collagen film according to claim 5 wherein the number of said drug reservoir layers is from one to three.
7. A collagen film according to claim 6 wherein the number of said drug reservoir layers is three.
8. A collagen film according to claim 7 wherein one or both rate controlling layers and said drug reservoir layers each have a thickness of from about 0.01 mm to about 1 mm.
9. A collagen film according to claim 8 wherein one or both rate controlling layers and at least one of said drug reservoir layers each have a thickness of from about 0.05 to about 0.5 mm.
10. A collagen film according to claim 9 wherein one or both rate controlling layers and at least one of said drug reservoir layers each have a thickness of from about 0.1 mm to about 0.2 mm.
11. A collagen film according to claim 10 wherein one or both rate controlling layers further comprise a plasticizer.
12. A collagen film according to claim 11 wherein said one or more drug reservoir layers further comprise a plasticizer.
13. A collagen film according to claim 12 wherein one or both rate controlling layers further comprise a stabilizing agent.
14. A collagen film according to claim 13 wherein said one or more drug reservoir layers further comprise a stabilizing agent.
15. A collagen film according to claim 14 wherein one or both rate controlling layers further comprise a drying enhancer.
16. A collagen film according to claim 15 wherein said one or more drug reservoir layers further comprise a drying enhancer.
17. A collagen film according to claim 16 wherein one or both rate controlling layers further comprise a buffer.
18. A collagen film according to claim 17 wherein said one or more drug reservoir layers further comprise a buffer.
19. A collagen film according to claim 18 wherein said active ingredient is selected from the group consisting of PDGF, EGF, FGF, PDEGF, PD-ECGF, KGF, IGF-1, IGF-2, TNF, BDNF, CNTF, and NT-3.
20. A collagen film according to claim 19 wherein said active ingredient is PDGF.
21. A method of enhancing wound healing of an epidermal wound comprising administration of a wound healing effective amount of an active ingredient via a collagen film according to claim 1.
22. A collagen film according to claim 1, wherein a rate controlling layer is situated at both ends of the stack.
23. A collagen film according to claim 22 wherein said rate controlling layers further comprise an active ingredient.
24. A collagen film according to claim 22 wherein at least one of said rate controlling layers is devoid of any active ingredient.
25. A collagen film according to claim 24 wherein said drug reservoir layers further comprise an active ingredient.
26. A collagen film according to claim 25 wherein the number of said drug reservoir layers is from one to five.
27. A collagen film according to claim 26 wherein the number of said drug reservoir layers is from one to three.
28. A collagen film according to claim 27 wherein the number of said drug reservoir layers is three.
29. A collagen film according to claim 28 wherein said rate controlling layers and said drug reservoir layers each have a thickness of from about 0.01 mm to about 1 mm.
30. A collagen film according to claim 29 wherein one or both rate controlling layers and at least one of said drug reservoir layers each have a thickness of from about 0.05 to about 0.5 mm.
31. A collagen film according to claim 30 wherein one or both rate controlling layers and at least one of said drug reservoir layers each have a thickness of from about 0.1 mm to about 0.2 mm.
32. A collagen film according to claim 31 wherein at least one of said rate controlling layers further comprises a plasticizer.
33. A collagen film according to claim 32 wherein at least one of said drug reservoir layers further comprises a plasticizer.
34. A collagen film according to claim 33 wherein at least one of said rate controlling layers further comprises a stabilizing agent.
35. A collagen film according to claim 34 wherein at least one of said drug reservoir layers further comprises a stabilizing agent.
36. A collagen film according to claim 34 wherein at least one of said rate controlling layers further comprises a drying enhancer.
37. A collagen film according to claim 35 wherein at least one of said drug reservoir layers further comprises a drying enhancer.
38. A collagen film according to claim 36 wherein at least one of said rate controlling layers further comprises a buffer.
39. A collagen film according to claim 37 wherein at least one of said drug reservoir layers further comprises a buffer.
40. A collagen film according to claim 39 wherein said active ingredient is selected from the group consisting of PDGF, EGF, FGF, PDEGF, PD-ECGF, KGF, IGF-1, IGF-2, and TNF.
41. A collagen film according to claim 40 wherein said active ingredient is PDGF.
