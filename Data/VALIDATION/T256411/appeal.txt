I. The appeal of the applicant (appellant) lies from the decision of the examining division announced at oral proceedings on 6 May 2011 to refuse European patent application n° 01 922 258.7.

II. The documents cited during the examination proceedings included the following:

D1: US-A-5,418,222

D2: EP-A-0 485 210

D5: J. Cappello et al., J. Controlled Release, 53 (1998), pages 105-117

III. The decision was based on two sets of claims filed with letter of 6 April 2011 as main request, and during oral proceedings on 6 May 2011 as auxiliary request.

Independent claim 1 of the main request related to a solvated compressed protein matrix material.

Independent claim 2 of the main request read as follows:

"2. A method of making a solvated compressed protein matrix material, comprising the steps of:

(a) preparing a coatable composition comprising one or more biocompatible protein materials and one or more biocompatible solvents;

(b) coating the composition to form a film;

(c) partially drying the coated film to a solvent content of 20% to 80% until the coated film can be formed into a non-brittle cohesive body;

(d) forming said cohesive body; and

(e) compressing the cohesive body to reduce bulk solvent and form a protein matrix material."

Independent claim 1 of the first auxiliary request read as follows:

"1. A method of making a solvated compressed protein matrix material, comprising the steps of:

(a) preparing a coatable composition comprising one or more biocompatible protein materials and one or more biocompatible solvents;

(b) coating the composition to form a film;

(c) partially drying the coated film to a solvent content of 35% to 80% until the coated film can be formed into a non-brittle cohesive body;

(d) forming said cohesive body; and

(e) compressing the cohesive body at a pressure of 689kPa to 689,500kPa (100psi to 100,000psi) for a time period of from 2 seconds to 48 hours to reduce bulk solvent and form a protein matrix material, having a solvent content of 30% to 50%."

IV. In its decision the examining division held inter alia that both D1 and D5 were prejudicial to the novelty of claim 1 of the main request.

The claims of the first auxiliary request met the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC. Novelty was established over D1 by virtue of the limitation of the solvent content of the product to the range of from 30 to 50%, and in that the pressure applied according to D1 is not further specified.

Claim 1 of the first auxiliary request did not meet the requirements of Article 56 EPC. D1 was the closest prior art since it related to collagen films for improving the sustained release delivery of a pharmaceutical, particularly in the context of enhancing wound healing. There was no evidence on file showing that the matrix material according to claim 1 was superior to that of D1 as alleged in terms of its strength, delayed degradation, and controlled delivery of an active agent. The pressure and time ranges recited were so broad that it was unlikely that an improvement could arise therefrom, and the claimed lower limit of 30% for the final solvent content of the material was within the range of the general teaching of D1 to provide from 10-30% glycerol. The objective technical problem was thus the provision of an alternative process for producing a solvated compressed protein matrix material. Such a process was conventional for the skilled person starting from the teaching of D1.

V. With the statement setting out the grounds of appeal dated 7 November 2011, the appellant submitted six sets of claims consisting of a main request and auxiliary requests 1-3, 5 and 6. A fourth claim set was not submitted, although the statement of grounds mentioned how such a request would be constructed.

Independent claim 2 was identical in the main request and the first to fourth auxiliary requests, and corresponded to independent claim 1 of the fifth auxiliary request. This claim was identical to claim 2 of the main request refused by the examining division (see point III above).

Independent claim 1 of the sixth auxiliary request corresponded to claim 1 of the first auxiliary request refused by the examining division (see point III above).

With the statement setting out the grounds of appeal the appellant furthermore submitted the following item of evidence:

Declaration of Dr Masters dated 6 November 2011

VI. In a communication dated 11 September 2015 issued in preparation for oral proceedings, the Board noted in the context of inventive step that the comparative data submitted with the Declaration of Dr Masters did not support the alleged effect of improved mechanical strength over the closest prior art D1. Consequently, with respect to claim 2 of the main request, the objective technical problem appeared to be the provision of an alternative process for the production of a protein matrix to that of D1, example 2, and the solution appeared obvious. Furthermore, the Board expressed the preliminary opinion that none of the amendments proposed according to the auxiliary requests would appear to lead to a different conclusion.

VII. Oral proceedings were held on 1 October 2015 in the absence of the appellant as announced with letter of 30 September 2015.

VIII. The appellant's arguments can be summarised as follows:

Main request

It was the method of manufacture which imparted the advantageous physical properties to the protein matrix material of the invention. The declaration of Dr Masters demonstrated that the material of claim 1, by virtue of its method of manufacture according to claim 2, was different from that disclosed in example 2 of D1, and displayed comparatively enhanced maximum tensile strength. As far as the process of preparation was concerned, D1 failed to disclose the features (c), (d) and (e) of claim 2. Claims 1 and 2 were thus novel. Inventive step was supported by the data provided in the declaration Dr Masters.

Auxiliary requests

Since the process claim according to the first, second, third and fifth auxiliary requests was identical to that of the main request, the arguments submitted in respect of the main request applied. Claim 1 of the sixth auxiliary request was further distinguished from D1 by the limited solvent content of the product, and was inventive by virtue of the unexpected advantageous properties conferred on the product, as demonstrated by the declaration of Dr Masters.

IX. The appellant requested in writing that the decision under appeal be set aside and a patent be granted on the basis of the set of claims of the main request, or alternatively on the basis of the sets of claims of the first to sixth auxiliary requests, all filed with the statement setting out the grounds of appeal.
