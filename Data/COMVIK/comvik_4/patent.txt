The differences between the subject-matter of claim 1 and D1 are:

(1) 
an IR camera is used (instead of the IR pyrometer of D1, which only captures the temperature at a single point of the surface);

(2) 
mean values for air temperature and relative air humidity measured inside the building over the last 24 hours are received;

(3) 
the condensation temperature is calculated on the basis of the mean air temperature and mean relative air humidity and compared to the temperature at each point on the IR image of the surface;

(4) 
image points having a temperature lower than the calculated condensation temperature are identified as areas at increased risk of condensation on the surface;

(5) 
colours are used to indicate areas at increased risk of condensation.
