Claim 1:

A computer-implemented method of determining areas in which there is an increased risk of condensation for a surface in a building comprising the steps of:

(a)
controlling an infrared (IR) camera to capture an image of the temperature distribution of the surface;

(b)
receiving mean values for the air temperature and the relative air humidity measured inside the building over the last 24 hours;

(c)
calculating, based on said mean air temperature and mean relative air humidity, a condensation temperature at which there is a risk of condensation on the surface;

(d)
comparing the temperature at each point on the image to said calculated condensation temperature;

(e)
identifying the image points having a temperature lower than the calculated condensation temperature as areas at increased risk of condensation on the surface; and

(f)
modifying the image by colouring the image points identified in step (e) in a particular colour to indicate the areas at increased risk of condensation to a user.
