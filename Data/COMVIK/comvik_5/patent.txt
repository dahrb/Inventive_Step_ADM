Claim 1:

A method for coating a workpiece using a thermal spray coating process, the method comprising:

(a)
applying, using a spray jet, a material to the workpiece by thermal spray coating;

(b)
monitoring the thermal spray coating process in real time by detecting properties of particles in the spray jet and supplying the properties as actual values;

(c)
comparing the actual values with target values;

and, in the event that the actual values deviate from the target values,

(d)
adjusting process parameters for the thermal spray coating process automatically by a controller on the basis of a neural network, said controller being a neuro-fuzzy controller which combines a neural-network and fuzzy logic rules and thereby maps statistical relationships between input variables and output variables of the neuro-fuzzy controller
