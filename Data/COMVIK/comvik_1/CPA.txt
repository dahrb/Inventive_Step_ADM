Step (ii): Document D1, which discloses a method for facilitating shopping on a mobile device wherein the user selects a single product and the server determines from a database the vendor selling the selected product nearest to the user and transmits this information to the mobile device, is selected as the closest prior art.

Step (iii): The differences between the subject-matter of claim 1 and D1 are:

(1)
The user can select two or more products to purchase (instead of a single product only). 

(2)
An "optimal shopping tour" for purchasing the two or more products is provided to the user. 

(3)
The optimal shopping tour is determined by the server by accessing a cache memory in which optimal shopping tours determined for previous requests are stored.
