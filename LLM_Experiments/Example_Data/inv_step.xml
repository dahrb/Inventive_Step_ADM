<abstract id="abst" lang="en">
<p id="pa01" num="0001">A passive thermal regulation assembly for cooling photovoltaic modules is disclosed. The assembly comprises a porous structural framework attached to the rear of a photovoltaic module, impregnated with a stimuli-responsive hydrogel. The hydrogel possesses a Lower Critical Solution Temperature (LCST) tuned to near-ambient temperatures (30-40°C). The system utilizes a diurnal cycle wherein the hydrogel absorbs atmospheric moisture during the night (below LCST) and undergoes a phase transition to a hydrophobic state during the day (above LCST). This transition releases the stored water within the porous framework, facilitating evaporative cooling of the module without the need for external power, water supply, or control systems.</p>

<description id="desc" lang="en">
<heading id="h0001"><b>Field of the Invention</b></heading>
<p id="p0001" num="0001">The present invention relates to the field of photovoltaic (PV) energy generation, and more particularly to thermal management systems for maintaining optimal operating temperatures of photovoltaic modules. The invention specifically concerns a passive cooling apparatus that utilizes atmospheric moisture harvesting.</p>
<heading id="h0002"><b>Background of the Invention</b></heading>
<p id="p0002" num="0002">It is well established in the art that the efficiency of photovoltaic cells decreases as their operating temperature increases. Standard silicon-based PV modules typically exhibit a temperature coefficient of power of approximately -0.4% to -0.5% per degree Celsius above standard test conditions (25°C). In high-irradiance environments, module temperatures can easily exceed 65°C, resulting in significant power loss and accelerated degradation of the encapsulant materials.</p>
<p id="p0003" num="0003">Prior art solutions for cooling PV modules generally fall into active or passive categories. Active cooling systems, such as forced air circulation or water spraying (e.g., EP 1 234 567 A1), provide effective cooling but require external power sources, pumps, and complex control circuitry, which introduce parasitic loads that offset the energy gains. Furthermore, active systems require maintenance and are prone to mechanical failure.</p>
<p id="p0004" num="0004">Passive cooling techniques typically rely on conductive heat sinks, such as aluminum fins adhered to the rear surface of the module. While reliable, these heat sinks rely solely on natural convection and radiation. Their cooling capacity is limited by the surface area and the ambient air temperature. In environments with high ambient temperatures and low wind speeds, conventional finned heat sinks often fail to maintain the PV module within an optimal efficiency range.</p>
<p id="p0005" num="0005">Other passive approaches involve Phase Change Materials (PCMs) that absorb latent heat during the day. However, typical PCMs (such as paraffin wax) suffer from low thermal conductivity and require a long time to regenerate (solidify) at night, particularly in tropical climates where nighttime temperatures remain high.</p>
<p id="p0006" num="0006">There remains a need for a cooling system that operates entirely passively, requires no external water supply, and provides a cooling capacity superior to simple convective heat sinks.</p>
<heading id="h0003"><b>Summary of the Invention</b></heading>
<p id="p0007" num="0007">The present invention provides a thermal regulation assembly for a photovoltaic module comprising a thermally conductive backsheet adapted to be in thermal communication with the photovoltaic cells, and a moisture-responsive cooling layer disposed adjacent to the backsheet. The assembly is characterised in that the cooling layer comprises a hygroscopic polymeric hydrogel matrix having a Lower Critical Solution Temperature (LCST) between 30°C and 40°C.</p>
<p id="p0008" num="0008">The invention leverages a diurnal cycle of absorption and desorption. During nocturnal hours, when the temperature of the assembly falls below the LCST, the hydrogel matrix transitions to a hydrophilic state, absorbing moisture from the ambient atmosphere. During daylight hours, as solar irradiance heats the PV module above the LCST, the hydrogel undergoes a phase transition to a hydrophobic state, expelling the stored water. This expelled water is retained within a porous transport structure where it undergoes evaporation, thereby removing latent heat from the PV module.</p>
<heading id="h0004"><b>Brief Description of the Drawings</b></heading>
<p id="p0009" num="0009">The invention will now be described in more detail, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying schematic drawings, in which:

<dt>Fig. 2</dt><dd>illustrates the molecular configuration of the hydrogel matrix in the hydrophilic (swollen) state.</dd>

<heading id="h0005"><b>Detailed Description of the Invention</b></heading>
<p id="p0010" num="0010">With reference to Fig. 1, a photovoltaic assembly 10 comprises a standard photovoltaic laminate 12 having a front glass surface 12a and a rear surface 12b. A thermal interface material 14 connects the rear surface 12b to the thermal regulation assembly 20.</p>
<p id="p0011" num="0011">The thermal regulation assembly 20 comprises a structural framework 22 formed of a high-thermal-conductivity material, preferably an open-cell aluminum foam or a graphite matrix. This framework 22 is impregnated with a stimuli-responsive hydrogel polymer 24.</p>
<p id="p0012" num="0012">In a preferred embodiment, the hydrogel polymer 24 is based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) or a copolymer thereof. The polymer is cross-linked to form a semi-interpenetrating network. The chemical composition is tuned such that the Lower Critical Solution Temperature (LCST) is set specifically between 32°C and 35°C.</p>
<p id="p0013" num="0013">The operation of the system relies on the volume phase transition of the hydrogel. During the night, the temperature of the PV module typically drops to ambient temperature, which is below the LCST. In this state, the polymer chains are hydrated and extended (Fig. 2). The matrix 24 absorbs water vapor from the air, swelling within the pores of the structural framework 22. The hydrogel is capable of absorbing up to 80% of its weight in atmospheric water, depending on relative humidity.</p>
<p id="p0014" num="0014">As solar irradiance begins, the temperature of the module 12 rises. Once the temperature of the thermal regulation assembly 20 exceeds the LCST, the hydrogen bonds between the water and the polymer chains break, and the polymer chains collapse into a globule state (Fig. 3). This transition forces liquid water out of the polymer network.</p>
<p id="p0015" num="0015">The expelled water forms a thin film on the large surface area of the open-cell framework 22. Because the framework 22 is in thermal contact with the heating PV module 12, the water absorbs thermal energy and evaporates. The specific enthalpy of vaporization of water (approx. 2260 kJ/kg) provides a significant heat sink, maintaining the module temperature substantially lower than a module cooled only by dry convection.</p>
<p id="p0016" num="0016">To prevent the loss of the hydrogel polymer 24 and to protect the system from dust ingress, the assembly 20 is enclosed on its exterior side by a semi-permeable membrane 26. The membrane 26 is permeable to water vapor but impermeable to liquid water and solid particulates. This ensures that during the evaporation phase, water vapor can escape to the atmosphere, and during the absorption phase, humid air can enter the matrix.</p>
<p id="p0017" num="0017">In a further embodiment, hygroscopic salts, such as Calcium Chloride (CaCl2), are embedded within the hydrogel matrix to lower the vapor pressure and enhance moisture harvesting capabilities in low-humidity environments.</p>
