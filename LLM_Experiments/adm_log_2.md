**Question:** Briefly describe the common general knowledge:
**Reasoning (extracted):**

```text
The invention combines two well‑known concepts: (1) umbrellas as rain‑shielding accessories and (2) portable LED lighting systems that use flexible light strips, rechargeable lithium‑ion batteries, and USB‑C charging. Both umbrellas and LED lighting devices are widely used in everyday life, and the integration of lighting into personal accessories (e.g., illuminated clothing, flash‑light‑equipped hats, or decorative glow umbrellas) is part of the public domain. Consequently, the idea that a canopy can house a thin, flexible LED array powered by a rechargeable battery and controlled by a simple switch or dimmer is considered common general knowledge among engineers and designers working in portable illumination and outdoor gear.

**Reasoning (extracted):**

```text
Among the four identified references, Patent US20170234567A1 ("Illuminated Umbrella") is the most directly comparable to the Umbrella Lamp. It discloses an umbrella whose canopy incorporates light‑emitting elements (fiber‑optic strands) powered by a detachable battery pack. Like the present invention, it combines a rain‑shielding umbrella with an integrated illumination system, and it is intended for hands‑free lighting in outdoor settings. Although the prior art uses fiber‑optic strands rather than flexible LED strips, and its power source is a removable battery rather than a built‑in rechargeable USB‑C pack with adjustable brightness, the overall concept of a dual‑purpose umbrella‑lamp is the same. Therefore US20170234567A1 is the closest prior art candidate.

```text
The closest prior‑art reference already discloses an umbrella that incorporates a light‑emitting system powered by a battery. For a skilled person, substituting the disclosed fiber‑optic strands with flexible LED strips, swapping a detachable battery pack for a built‑in rechargeable lithium‑ion cell, and adding a USB‑C charging port and adjustable‑brightness control are routine design choices that are well‑known in the field of portable lighting. These changes do not require any inventive effort beyond ordinary skill, so the prior art can be modified to arrive at the claimed Umbrella Lamp with only minimal modifications.

We need to answer the current question: "Does the closest prior art document require minimal modifications to the invention as assessed from the perspective of the skilled person?" Options: 1. Yes 2. No. Need to decide based on prior analysis.

We have description: Closest prior art US20170234567A1 uses fiber-optic strands, detachable battery pack, no adjustable brightness, no USB-C, etc. The invention uses flexible LED strips, built-in rechargeable battery with USB-C, adjustable brightness, dual-purpose design.

Question: Does the prior art require minimal modifications to achieve the invention? Minimal modifications means that a skilled person could adapt the prior art to the invention with routine modifications, not inventive step.

We need to evaluate: Are the differences (LED strips vs fiber-optic, built-in rechargeable battery vs detachable, USB-C charging, adjustable brightness) considered minimal? Likely not minimal; they involve replacing fiber-optic with LED strips, integrating battery, adding control circuitry. That may be more than minimal modifications. However, given common general knowledge of LED strips and rechargeable batteries, a skilled person could replace fiber-optic with LED strips and integrate a rechargeable battery with USB-C, which might be considered routine. But the question is about minimal modifications: The prior art already discloses umbrella with lighting; adding LED strips and rechargeable battery is a straightforward substitution. Many would consider that minimal.

We need to decide. In typical patent analysis, if the differences are just known alternatives (LED strips vs fiber-optic) and known power sources, it may be considered obvious, thus minimal modifications. So answer likely "Yes".

Thus answer JSON: reasoning and answer 1.

Let's craft reasoning: The skilled person can replace fiber-optic with flexible LED strips, use known rechargeable Li-ion battery with USB-C, add brightness control, all within routine design choices. Therefore minimal modifications.

Provide JSON.

Answer (y/n):
**Reasoning (extracted):**

```text
The closest prior art (US20170234567A1) discloses an illuminated umbrella but lacks several distinguishing features of the claimed Umbrella Lamp, such as flexible LED strip lighting, a built‑in rechargeable lithium‑ion battery with USB‑C charging, and adjustable brightness controls. The other cited references each provide one or more of these missing elements: CN108123456A teaches rigid LED modules on umbrella ribs, the commercial "Glow Umbrella" shows flexible LED strips powered by removable batteries, and WO2019045678 discloses a flexible LED panel with a built‑in rechargeable battery and USB‑C charging. By combining the structural concept of US20170234567A1 with the lighting and power‑management teachings of the other documents, a skilled person could arrive at the claimed invention without inventive effort. Therefore, there is a clear reason to combine the additional documents with the CPA to argue obviousness.

The closest prior art (US20170234567A1) already discloses an umbrella that emits light, but it uses fiber‑optic strands, a detachable battery pack, and lacks adjustable brightness. The other references disclose complementary features that address these shortcomings: (1) CN108123456A teaches rigid LED modules on umbrella ribs, (2) the Glow Umbrella product shows integrated LED strips with simple on/off control, and (3) WO2019045678 teaches flexible LED panels powered by a built‑in rechargeable lithium‑ion battery with USB‑C charging and multiple lighting modes. A practitioner seeking to improve the CPA would have a clear incentive to combine these teachings to replace fiber‑optics with flexible LED strips, integrate a rechargeable USB‑C battery, and add brightness control—features that directly solve the CPA’s disadvantages. Therefore, the skilled person would have a direct motive to combine the CPA with the other documents.

```text
The use of flexible LED light strips embedded in the umbrella canopy provides a distinct technical advantage over the prior art’s fiber‑optic strands. LED strips allow direct electrical illumination, adjustable brightness, multiple lighting modes, and integration with a built‑in rechargeable battery and USB‑C charging. These capabilities enable the umbrella to function as a reliable, hands‑free lamp with controllable light output, which the prior art does not disclose. Therefore, this feature contributes an independent technical effect to the invention.

The invention replaces fiber‑optic strands with flexible LED strips, adds a built‑in rechargeable battery and USB‑C charging, and provides adjustable brightness. All of these elements are well‑known in the lighting and portable‑device art. Substituting LEDs for fiber‑optics and integrating a rechargeable battery do not produce a surprising technical effect; they are straightforward, incremental improvements that a skilled person would readily arrive at. Therefore the technical effect is not unexpected or surprising.

We need to answer the current question: "Does the feature make a contribution in combination with other technical features to the invention?" The feature is built‑in rechargeable lithium‑ion battery pack. We need to output JSON with reasoning and answer (y/n). We should consider prior context: they earlier answered for flexible LED light strips: both independent and combination contributions were yes. For battery pack, likely also yes because it works with LED strips and USB-C etc. So answer y. Provide reasoning: battery pack enables power, integrates with USB-C, adjustable brightness, etc. So answer y.

Answer (y/n):
**Reasoning (extracted):**

```text
A built‑in rechargeable lithium‑ion battery pack is a hardware component that provides electrical energy to the LED lighting system. It is a purely technical solution addressing the need for portable power and does not implement any non‑technical method such as game rules, business processes, or administrative steps. Consequently, it does not serve to circumvent a technical problem by using a non‑technical method; rather, it directly solves the technical problem of supplying reliable, rechargeable power to the umbrella lamp.

Is the technical effect unexpected or surprising?
Answer (y/n):
**Reasoning (extracted):**

```text
The prior art already discloses an umbrella with a detachable battery pack for illumination. Incorporating a built‑in rechargeable lithium‑ion battery with USB‑C charging is a straightforward, well‑known engineering solution in portable lighting devices and does not produce an effect that would be considered unexpected or surprising to a skilled person. Therefore, the technical effect of the built‑in rechargeable battery is not unexpected.

We need to answer the current question: "Is the technical effect unexpected or surprising?" The user is in the middle of a questionnaire. We need to output JSON with reasoning and answer. The answer should be "y" or "n". Based on previous evaluation, they answered earlier for flexible LED strips: "Is the technical effect unexpected or surprising?" they answered "n". For built-in rechargeable battery, they haven't answered yet. We need to decide if the technical effect of the built-in rechargeable lithium-ion battery pack is unexpected or surprising compared to prior art. Prior art US20170234567A1 uses detachable battery pack, not built-in rechargeable. The invention's built-in rechargeable battery with USB-C charging and adjustable brightness may be considered an improvement but not unexpected.

```text
The adjustable brightness settings and multiple lighting modes rely on the LED strips, the built‑in rechargeable battery, and the control electronics (e.g., microcontroller, driver circuitry). By themselves they provide a user‑interface function, but their technical effect (variable illumination) is realized only when combined with the other hardware components of the Umbrella Lamp.

Answer (y/n):
**Reasoning (extracted):**

```text
Adjustable brightness settings and multiple lighting modes are implemented through electronic control circuitry and firmware that modulate LED drive current or PWM duty cycles. This is a purely technical solution to provide user‑adjustable illumination levels and patterns.

Does the feature make an independent technical contribution to the invention?
Answer (y/n):
**Reasoning (extracted):**

```text
The weather‑resistant construction improves the umbrella's ability to function reliably under adverse environmental conditions (rain, humidity, dust). This functional improvement is not merely a by‑product of other features but provides a distinct technical advantage—enhanced durability and protection of the integrated LED and battery components. Therefore it constitutes an independent technical contribution to the invention.

**Question:** Is the feature a technical implementation of a non-technical method i.e. game rules or a business method, and does it circumvent the technical problem rather than addressing it in an inherently technical way?
Answer (y/n):
**Reasoning (extracted):**

```text
Weather‑resistant construction pertains to the selection of materials, sealing techniques, and structural design that protect the umbrella and its electronic components from moisture, rain, and dust. These are purely technical engineering solutions aimed at solving a physical problem (environmental protection). They do not implement a non‑technical method such as a game rule or business process, nor do they attempt to circumvent any technical problem by using such a method. Therefore, the feature is a straightforward technical contribution rather than a non‑technical implementation.

Is the technical effect unexpected or surprising?
Answer (y/n):
**Reasoning (extracted):**

```text
Weather‑resistant construction is a well‑known engineering solution for outdoor accessories. The skilled person would routinely select waterproof fabrics, sealed seams, and corrosion‑resistant components to protect the umbrella and its electronic parts from rain and moisture. Such measures are standard in the field and do not produce an effect that exceeds normal expectations. Therefore, the technical effect of the weather‑resistant construction is not unexpected or surprising.
