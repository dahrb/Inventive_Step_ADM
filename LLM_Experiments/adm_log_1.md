## Step 5 - 21:56:13
## **Question:** **"


Do the candidate relevant prior art documents have a similar purpose to the invention?
1. They have the same or a very similar purpose.
2. They have a different purpose.
Choose an answer (enter number): "**

### Reasoning (extracted)
```text
The inventor indicated that there is no relevant prior art ('no'). Since there are no candidate prior art documents, they cannot share the same or a very similar purpose as the invention. Therefore, the appropriate choice is that they have a different purpose (i.e., effectively no comparable purpose).
```

<details>
<summary>Show hidden/raw reasoning</summary>

```text
We need to answer the question: "Do the candidate relevant prior art documents have a similar purpose to the invention? 1. They have the same or a very similar purpose. 2. They have a different purpose. Choose an answer (enter number):"

We have prior art: "no". So there are no candidate relevant prior art documents. If there are none, then the question about similarity is moot. Likely answer: 2 (different purpose) because there are none, so they cannot have same purpose. Or perhaps we should say 2 because there are no documents, thus they do not have similar purpose. Provide reasoning.

Return JSON with reasoning and answer.
```

</details>

### Decision
**Answer:** `2`

## Step 6 - 21:56:18
## **Question:** **"


Are there similar technical effects between the candidate relevant prior art documents and the invention?
1. It produces a similar technical effect.
2. It produces a different technical effect.
Choose an answer (enter number): "**

### Reasoning (extracted)
```text
The response to the prior art question indicated that there are no relevant prior art documents ("no"). With no candidate documents to compare, there can be no overlap in technical effects. Therefore, the invention's technical effects are different (i.e., absent) relative to any prior art.
```

<details>
<summary>Show hidden/raw reasoning</summary>

```text
We need to answer the current question: Are there similar technical effects between the candidate relevant prior art documents and the invention? The prior art is "no" (they said "relevant prior art: no"). So there are no candidate prior art documents. The question asks to choose 1 or 2. Since there are no prior art documents, there cannot be similar technical effects. So answer 2: It produces a different technical effect (i.e., none). Provide reasoning.

We must output valid JSON with keys 'reasoning' and 'answer'. So something like:

{
  "reasoning": "...",
  "answer": "2"
}

Make sure it's proper JSON string.

## Step 7 - 21:56:23
## **Question:** **"


What is the relationship between the candidate relevant prior art documents and the invention's technical field? 

Invention Technical Field: wearable robotics and personal mobility engineering, specifically the integration of photovoltaic energy harvesting into exoskeleton systems for sustainable, powered human locomotion. 


1. It is from the exact same technical field.
2. It is from a closely related or analogous technical field.
3. It is from an unrelated technical field.
Choose an answer (enter number): "**

### Reasoning (extracted)
```text
The prior art section indicates that there are no relevant prior art documents ("no"). With no documents to compare, they cannot be considered to belong to the same or a closely related technical field. Therefore, the relationship is best described as unrelated.
```

<details>
<summary>Show hidden/raw reasoning</summary>

```text
We need to answer the current question: relationship between candidate relevant prior art documents and invention's technical field. Prior art was "no" meaning none? The prior art documents presumably none, but we need to choose among options. Since there are no candidate prior art documents, they are not from any field; perhaps "unrelated technical field"? But if there are none, maybe we consider that they are not from the same field, so answer 3. Provide reasoning.

Output JSON with keys 'reasoning' and 'answer'. Answer should be number as string? Probably integer. We'll output answer: 3.
```

</details>

### Decision
**Answer:** `3`

## Step 8 - 21:56:32
## **Question:** **"

Briefly describe the common general knowledge: "**

### Reasoning (extracted)
```text
To establish the baseline of what is generally known, we consider widely recognized facts in the fields of photovoltaics, wearable robotics, and personal mobility. It is common knowledge that sunlight can be converted into electrical energy using photovoltaic (PV) cells, that flexible and thin‑film PV technologies exist and can be integrated onto curved surfaces, and that batteries can store harvested solar power. It is also generally known that powered exoskeletons and assistive wearable robots have been developed to augment human locomotion, providing motorized assistance for walking, jogging, or climbing. Moreover, the integration of electronic components (sensors, controllers, power management circuits) into wearable structures is a standard practice in modern wearable technology. These widely accepted facts constitute the common general knowledge relevant to the invention.

## Step 12 - 21:56:51
## **Question:** **"

Does the practitioner have access to all documents comprising the state of the art?

Common General Knowledge: no


Answer (y/n): "**

### Reasoning (extracted)
```text
The case indicates that there is no common general knowledge in the relevant technical field. Without such baseline knowledge, we cannot presume that the practitioner has comprehensive access to every document that constitutes the state of the art. Therefore, the appropriate response is that the practitioner does not have access to all such documents.

```text
We need to answer the current question: "Does the practitioner have access to all documents comprising the state of the art?" with yes/no. Also include reasoning. Provide JSON with keys 'reasoning' and 'answer'.

We have context: Common General Knowledge: no. That means there is no common general knowledge. The practitioner presumably does not have access to all documents comprising the state of the art? Usually, if common general knowledge is absent, we cannot assume they have access to all documents. The default is likely "n". So answer "n". Provide reasoning: Since no common general knowledge, and no indication that practitioner has full access, we assume they do not have access to all documents. Provide JSON.

```text
We need to answer the current question: "What is the nature of this practitioner? 1. An individual practitioner 2. A research team 3. A production or manufacturing team 4. Other". Based on prior answers: they said practitioner possesses average knowledge and ability for that field (y). They are aware? No. Access to documents? No. So likely an individual practitioner? Could be a research team? The invention is a new exoskeleton; likely a research team developing it. But the questionnaire seems to assess practitioner for patent evaluation. Usually the practitioner is the inventor or a skilled person in the art. Could be a research team. However they answered "Does the practitioner possess average knowledge and ability for that field?" Yes. That could be either individual or team. No other info. I'd choose "2. A research team" because invention is complex, likely a team. But could be individual inventor. The prior fields: they said "no" for common general knowledge, meaning it's new field. Might be a research team exploring new field. I'll answer 2.

## Step 15 - 21:57:11
## **Question:** **"


Is the closest prior art document itself a single reference?
1. Yes
2. No
Choose an answer (enter number): "**

### Reasoning (extracted)
```text
The earlier response indicated that there is no relevant prior art ('Please briefly describe the relevant prior art: A: no'). Since no prior art document exists, there cannot be a "closest" prior art document, and therefore it cannot be a single reference. The appropriate answer is 'No'.
```

<details>
<summary>Show hidden/raw reasoning</summary>

```text
We need to answer the current question: "Is the closest prior art document itself a single reference? 1. Yes 2. No". Based on prior info: they said "Please briefly describe the relevant prior art: A: no". So there is no prior art. Therefore the question about closest prior art document being a single reference is not applicable. But we must choose an answer. If there is no prior art, then there is no closest prior art document, so the answer would be "No" because there is no document. Or perhaps we should answer "2" (No). Provide reasoning.

Return JSON with reasoning and answer.

### Reasoning (extracted)
```text
The workflow attempts to evaluate the 'cpa_min_mod' (minimum modifications to the closest prior art) but all prerequisite dependencies for identifying a closest prior art document remain unsatisfied. No prior art has been established, and the relevant fields (RelevantPriorArt, SingleReference, etc.) could not be satisfied. Without a concrete prior art reference, it is impossible to determine what modifications would be required to arrive at the SolarStride invention. Therefore, the answer must acknowledge that the minimum modification cannot be assessed in the current state of the case.

<summary>Show hidden/raw reasoning</summary>

```text
We need to answer the current question. The system shows a lot of dependency evaluation logs. The current question is: "Trying to evaluate dependency SkilledPerson for cpa_min_mod ..." but that's just logs. The actual user request: "You are answering questions about a new invention of your choosing Answer the current question." The previous Q&A have built a case for invention "solarstride". Now the system is trying to evaluate dependencies for various fields but many cannot be satisfied. The current question likely expects us to provide an answer to the current question, which is about "cpa_min_mod"? Let's scroll: The logs show "Trying to evaluate dependency SkilledPerson for cpa_min_mod". So the current question is likely: "Does the practitioner possess average knowledge and ability for that field?" Already answered y. Then "Is the practitioner presumed to be aware of the common general knowledge in the field?" answered n. Then "Does the practitioner have access to all documents comprising the state of the art?" answered n. Then "What is the nature of this practitioner?" answered 2 (research team). Then "Please describe the research team:" answered no. Then "Is the closest prior art document itself a single reference?" answered 2 (No). So after that, the system is trying to evaluate dependencies for cpa_min_mod, which likely stands for "closest prior art minimum modifications". The question may be: "What is the minimum modification needed to the closest prior art to arrive at the invention?" But the dependencies cannot be satisfied because prior art not identified. So maybe we need to answer that we cannot determine min modifications because no prior art identified. The instruction: Output valid JSON with keys 'reasoning' and 'answer'.

Thus we should explain that due to lack of identified prior art, we cannot assess minimum modifications. Answer likely "Not applicable" or "Cannot be determined". Provide reasoning.

Thus produce JSON.

Is the invention merely the new use of known properties of a well-known material i.e. A washing composition containing as detergent, a known compound having the known property of lowering the surface tension of water.
Answer (y/n): "**

### Reasoning (extracted)
```text
The invention, SolarStride, is an integrated wearable exoskeleton that combines flexible photovoltaic cells, power management electronics, and assistive actuation to provide sustainable personal mobility. This goes beyond merely applying a known material (e.g., a photovoltaic polymer) for its established property (light‑to‑electric conversion). It involves a novel system architecture, mechanical design, and functional interaction that are not present in the prior art. Therefore, it is not merely a new use of a known material’s property.

## **Question:** **"Does the invention just apply a known technique in a closely analogous situation?
Answer (y/n): "**

### Reasoning (extracted)
```text
The invention combines two distinct technologies—wearable exoskeleton robotics and flexible photovoltaic energy harvesting—into a single integrated system that provides powered personal mobility. While photovoltaic cells and exoskeletons are known individually, there is no prior art that integrates them in this manner for sustainable locomotion. Therefore, the invention is not merely the application of a known technique to a closely analogous situation; it represents a novel technical solution.

## Step 19 - 21:57:41
## **Question:** **"Does the invention rely on known devices?
Answer (y/n): "**

### Reasoning (extracted)
```text
SolarStride incorporates existing, well‑known hardware components—flexible photovoltaic panels, electric motors/actuators, battery storage, and a conventional exoskeleton frame. While the inventive step lies in how these devices are integrated and controlled to provide sustainable personal mobility, the system does depend on those known devices as its building blocks.

We need to answer the current question: "Does the invention rely on known devices?" Provide reasoning and answer (y/n). Based on prior info: invention is solarstride: integrated photovoltaic exoskeleton. It seems novel combination of exoskeleton and photovoltaic cells. Does it rely on known devices? It uses known devices like photovoltaic cells, exoskeleton frames, motors, battery. But the invention integrates them in a new way. The question likely asks whether the invention relies on known devices (i.e., uses existing devices as components). Since it uses known components, answer likely "y". However, the prior steps indicated that prior art is none, and they said no prior art. But the question is about reliance on known devices, not prior art. The invention uses known devices (photovoltaic cells, exoskeleton actuators). So answer yes.

Provide reasoning: The exoskeleton uses existing flexible PV cells, motors, batteries, which are known devices; the novelty is integration. So it does rely on known devices.

## Step 20 - 21:57:48
## **Question:** **"Is the invention a simple juxtaposition of the known devices, with each performing their normal, expected function?
Answer (y/n): "**

### Reasoning (extracted)
```text
The solarstride system does more than merely place existing devices side by side. While exoskeleton frames, photovoltaic cells, batteries, and assistive motors are known individually, the invention integrates flexible PV modules into the structural components of a wearable exoskeleton, implements power‑management circuitry, and coordinates motor assistance with harvested solar energy. This requires novel mechanical integration, electrical routing, and control algorithms that go beyond a simple juxtaposition where each component functions independently in its usual manner.

## Step 21 - 21:57:56
## **Question:** **"Does the invention rely within a known device, simply substituting in a recently developed material suitable for that use?
Answer (y/n): "**

### Reasoning (extracted)
```text
SolarStride incorporates a wearable exoskeleton—a known device—but its novelty lies in embedding flexible photovoltaic cells and associated power‑management and assistive‑motor systems. This is more than merely swapping an existing component for a new material; it creates a new functional capability (self‑powered locomotion) that the original device did not have. Therefore the invention does not merely rely on a known device with a simple material substitution.

We need to answer the current question: "Does the invention rely within a known device, simply substituting in a recently developed material suitable for that use?" The prior answers: invention is solarstride integrated photovoltaic exoskeleton. They answered earlier: "Does the invention rely on known devices?" answer y. "Is the invention a simple juxtaposition of the known devices, with each performing their normal, expected function?" answer n. Now this question asks about substituting a recently developed material within a known device. Solarstride uses flexible photovoltaic cells integrated into exoskeleton frame. The device (exoskeleton) is known, but the material (flexible PV cells) is a recently developed material. However the invention is more than just substitution; it integrates energy harvesting and propulsion. So does it rely within a known device, simply substituting material? Likely no, because it's not just substitution; it's a new functional integration. So answer n.

Provide reasoning: The invention uses known exoskeleton hardware but adds photovoltaic cells, which is more than simple material substitution; it changes function, adds power generation, control systems. So answer no.

## Step 22 - 21:58:04
## **Question:** **"Does the invention result from a choice between equally likely alternatives?
Answer (y/n): "**

### Reasoning (extracted)
```text
The solarstride exoskeleton was devised to address a specific technical problem—providing sustainable, on‑board power for personal mobility. The decision to embed flexible photovoltaic cells, rather than, for example, larger batteries, fuel cells, or external charging stations, was driven by concrete technical considerations such as weight, form factor, continuous energy harvesting, and environmental goals. These alternatives were not equally likely; the chosen solution was selected because it best satisfied the identified performance and sustainability criteria. Therefore, the invention does not arise from a mere choice among equally likely alternatives.

We need to answer the current question: "Does the invention result from a choice between equally likely alternatives?" The user is filling a questionnaire for patent obviousness analysis. We need to answer yes or no with reasoning.

We have the invention: solarstride integrated photovoltaic exoskeleton. Does it result from a choice between equally likely alternatives? That question asks whether the invention is the result of selecting among alternatives that were equally likely to be chosen. Typically, if the invention is a design choice among multiple options, and the choice was not driven by technical effect, then maybe yes. But here, the invention integrates photovoltaic cells into exoskeleton for sustainable mobility. The choice to embed PV cells vs other power sources (e.g., batteries, fuel cells) might have been driven by the desire for solar energy. Not equally likely; there are reasons. So answer likely "no". Provide reasoning: The design is driven by technical problem (need for sustainable power) and the solution is not just a random choice among equally likely alternatives; it's based on technical considerations, performance, weight, etc.

Thus answer JSON with reasoning and answer "n".
