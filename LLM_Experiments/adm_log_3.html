Therefore, the closest prior art does **not** require only minimal modifications to arrive at the claimed invention.\n```\n<details>\n<summary>Show hidden/raw reasoning</summary>\n\n```text\nWe need to answer the question: Does the closest prior art document require minimal modifications to the invention as assessed from the perspective of the skilled person? Options: 1 Yes, 2 No.\n\nWe must provide reasoning and answer in JSON.\n\nWe need to evaluate whether the prior art WO 2018/123456 A1 would require only minimal modifications to arrive at the claimed Umbrella Lamp. The differences listed: LED integration method (flexible strips woven vs discrete perimeter LEDs), power management (multi-mode dimming, solar charging vs single on/off USB), waterproof sealing (IPX7 vs simple coating), mechanical design (telescopic shaft with battery vs fixed handle battery). Are these modifications minimal? Likely not minimal; they involve substantial redesign (integrating flexible LED strips throughout canopy, adding solar panel, redesigning shaft, improved sealing). So answer No (2).\n\nProvide reasoning: The skilled person would see that to achieve the claimed features, they would need to redesign the LED layout, add solar charging, implement multi-mode controller, redesign waterproofing, and modify mechanical architecture. These are not trivial modifications; they go beyond routine optimization. Therefore minimal modifications not required.\n\nReturn JSON with reasoning and answer.\n\n\n```\n\n</details>\n**Answer:** `2`---\n\n<!-- JSON: {\"turn\": 18, \"time\": \"22:34:52\", \"question\": \"Trying to evaluate dependency SkilledPerson for cpa_min_mod\\n Trying to evaluate dependency SkilledPerson for cpa_min_mod\\n  \ud83d\udccb SkilledPerson has children: ['SkilledIn', 'Average', 'Aware', 'Access', 'Person']\\n    \u26a0\ufe0f  Child SkilledIn has no acceptance conditions\\n    \u26a0\ufe0f  Child Average has no acceptance conditions\\n    \u26a0\ufe0f  Child Aware has no acceptance conditions\\n    \u26a0\ufe0f  Child Access has no acceptance conditions\\n    \ud83d\udd0d Evaluating child dependency: Person\\n Trying to evaluate dependency Person for child of SkilledPerson\\n  \ud83d\udccb Person has children: ['Individual', 'ResearchTeam', 'ProductionTeam']\\n    \u26a0\ufe0f  Child Individual has no acceptance conditions\\n    \ud83d\udd0d Evaluating child dependency: ResearchTeam\\n    \ud83d\udd0d Evaluating child dependency: ProductionTeam\\n  \u2705 Children evaluated, now evaluating Person\\n\u2705 Added Person to case\\n\u2705 Dependency Person now satisfied for child of SkilledPerson\\n  \u2705 Children evaluated, now evaluating SkilledPerson\\n\u2705 Added SkilledPerson to case\\n\u2705 Dependency SkilledPerson now satisfied for cpa_min_mod\\n\\n\\n\\nDoes the closest prior art document require minimal modifications to the invention as assessed from the perspective of the skilled person? \\n\\n The skilled person: An individual practitioner who is a mid\u2011level product engineer or designer with a background in portable electronic lighting and consumer accessory development.

Although the invention is not deemed obvious, the prior art covers the same field and no distinguishing technical features are identified, resulting in a lack of novelty and no valid objective technical problem. Consequently, the invention does not meet the patentability requirements.\n```\n<details>\n<summary>Show hidden/raw reasoning</summary>\n\n```text\nWe need to summarize session output and give final decision Yes/No with brief reasoning.

Contradictory: says not obvious but also no novelty and no inventive step. For patentability, need novelty and inventive step. Since no novelty, answer No (not patentable).
